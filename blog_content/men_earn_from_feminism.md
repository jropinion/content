Title: What Can Men Earn From Feminism?

I am a man and I am a feminist. Seems weird, I know. If feminism is the doctrine of man-hate, my subscription to it might appear to be a red-flag; a signal that I hate myself and those like me. But I don’t hate myself. I’m a feminist because I love women. Not just my mom, sister, girlfriend, and grandma. I love my female friends, too. In fact, I didn’t really understand my role in the feminist cause, or what the feminist cause had to offer me until a very smart friend explained to me the value feminism has for men.

I had assumed Feminism was a worthwhile endeavor, given it’s dedication to establishing a fair society that didn’t use the sex and gender of women against them arbitrarily. But, as this friend explained to me, Feminism also hopes to combat harmful male gender roles that insidiously cheapen my experience of life as well. Hell, I might still have thought she was crazy had her wisdom not been handed to me while I was in a college aka the bastion of destructive gender roles.

Society tells me I have to be hypersexual, that as a man I must desire sex all the time and have it whenever the opportunity presents itself. If that means ruining friendships, sleeping with girls I’m not attracted to, or, perhaps taking it by advanced persuasion (read: force), then so be it. But, I am not that guy. I tried to be because I thought I had to be. But that just isn’t me.

Society tells me that I must be the consummate masculine man, that at all times I must be stoic or angry. I’m not allowed to have a sensitive side, and only the most catastrophic events can excuse a brief lapse in my facade of manliness. If my dog dies (god forbid) or some other terrible tragedy strikes, I’m allowed 4 tears and one day of passive mourning during which I mostly avoid seeking consolation from my friends and keep to myself. But, I am not that guy. I tried to be because I thought I had to be. But, that just isn’t me.

Society tells me that the measure of my being is my ability to dominate situations, athletic, personal, relational, and otherwise. I have to be the leader; the alpha-male at all times. I am perpetually in competition with all other men. For the gaze of the prized “pretty girl,” for the spot on top of the totem pole. I have a strong personality. And I like to lead. But few people, myself included, are one thing all the time.

Even now, as I write, I can feel my internalized sense of what it means to be a man clawing at the inside of my chest; demanding I stop whining, insisting I “man-up.” Perhaps, you, my fellow man, are reading this now and having a similar visceral reaction. But what Feminism has made apparent to me is that I have a penis and that’s all I need to be a man. The rest of these socially promoted behaviors and attitudes do not define me. And, though my life for a long time was dedicated to these toxic ideals, I am lately feeling quite liberated to be myself and quite excited to see what that entails.

I’ll have sex as often as I want to, not as often as society thinks I should. I’ll be as masculine or as sensitive as I want to be depending on how I feel. I’ll compete for the things that mean something to me, and only those things (perpetual competition is exhausting). What can a man earn from Feminism? Well, society says be a man. Feminism says be yourself.
