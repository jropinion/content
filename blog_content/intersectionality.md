Title: The Importance of Intersectionality

All oppression is connected. This idea is at the core of intersectionality. Intersectional critics have recognized several essential truths about the nature of oppression. And, through recognizing these truths, have further identified gaping holes that are necessarily present in any social justice advocacy that does not acknowledge or give proper weight to intersectional considerations.

The first and most obvious question to be answered here is “what is intersectionality?”. Intersectionality (less commonly referred to as intersectionalism) is the study of the connections between different mechanisms of oppression. For example, where one may look at the treatment of blacks by police or one may look at the treatment of the mentally handicapped by the police, an intersectional analysis might compare and contrast the two police caused plights, and perhaps further distinguish the two individuals plights from a more narrow inquiry into the police caused plight of black mentally handicapped people.

The next question one might want to ask, “why would someone do that?”, provides the perfect segue back to what I mentioned above: “Intersectional critics have recognized several essential truths about the nature of oppression.” Those truths are: (1) that the oppression of several segments of society are connected because they tend to all be inspired by the empowered class exploiting and discriminating against those who do not belong to that class and (2) that belonging to multiple oppressed identities leads to nuanced manifestations of that oppression that are not present when one focuses too narrowly on any particular identity. To make this more concrete, and answer the question that opens this paragraph, let’s return to the discussion of the black mentally handicapped person being harassed by police.

A unilateral analysis of either the black person or the mentally handicapped person being harassed by police would surely reveal interesting and important things (like that blacks are presumed guilty or that the mentally handicapped are presumed dangerous). But the intersectional lenses of analysis might help one discern what motivates police brutality at its roots or what unique experiences might arise from the simultaneous presumption of violence and guilt. This enhanced form of analysis enables greater discussion and better proposals of solutions.

I take the most important contribution of intersectional thought to be the reassurance that no one is left behind. It is really easy when focusing on the oppression of any given group to turn a blind eye to plights faced by individuals in other vulnerable groups. The most commonly promulgated example is early feminist thought. When feminist focused on women’s issues exclusively, they routinely failed to acknowledge issues that black women faced specifically. 

But feminist are not alone. The black community, for example, deals with high instances of homophobia and race critics often leave out black women. There is an overwhelming overlooking of the mentally handicap in the social justice ranks. And, though this is a controversial point, I think there is also very little talk about what is just for the oppressor (for more on this point which may sound crazy read “What Are White Men Owed.” I say these things not to point fingers, but more to show how intersectionality has been ignored. There is strength in numbers. Any serious social justice advocate has to actual advocate for social justice and not just justice for particular segments of society.

P.S. As experience makes us wiser and time reveals injustices that seemed commonplace when they occurred, the only thing that remains true is that we are all in this together.
