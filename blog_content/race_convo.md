Title: A Conversation about Race
Category: Race
Date: 2015/06/25

If you care about race issues, you’ve probably had intense conversations with people who don’t. In those conversations, you’ve been frustrated, appalled, confused, and incredulous of how anyone could be so oblivious to the obvious racially insensitive and racist implications of their speech. I have those conversations, too. Toward the end of my college career, I had my most memorable conversation about race to date, and I’d like to share it with you. I will be abbreviating the names of the individuals involved as this is not about shaming them. I will also be providing a little context for the conversation.

At my school, some students, to raise awareness of the perpetual violence against black bodies taking place in America, staged a few demonstrations around campus. These demonstrations included making chalk outlines that one would find at the scene of a murder and writing the names of various students of color in them, writing “black lives matter” on frequently used paths, and throwing a black cover over some of the prominent statues on campus. No property was destroyed and nothing was irremediably altered. The goal of the protests, as I understood it, was to make the tragedies of the last couple months (dare I say years) more personal and apparent to a campus population that had, at large, proven itself indifferent to the plights of minorities in this country and hostile to conversations about those plights.

The next day, the professor of my Political Theory Literature class decided to forego discussing the book and instead use the class as a barometer to see how the students in the class felt about the demonstrations. The following is a rough transcript of that conversation.

Me: “I think it’s great. No property was damaged and the message was conveyed very intensely. People are talking about the demonstrations (obviously) and as a result people are talking about the issues that motivated them. This is textbook political speech.”

B: “I disagree. Defacing statues is not speech. It’s just vandalism.”

Me: “Nothing was defaced.”

C: “I understand the point behind the demonstrations. But I disagree. I feel like obsessing over these killings just contributes to the idea that all cops are bad and that the unarmed people killed were completely innocent. There isn’t tyranny in this country. Not all cops are bad. Yes, sometimes cops make mistakes, but we need to understand that that’s all it is: mistakes. I want to be a cop (Keep this in mind, please). And it’s a hard time to have that goal. People are starting to hate cops which makes it harder for cops to do their jobs. ”

Y: “The only mistake would be to understand the repeated killings as isolated mistakes. These killings are evidence of a larger system of oppression and [devaluation of black bodies]. Your willingness to look the other way is further evidence that you don’t understand that black lives matter, making the protests that much more necessary.”

B: “All lives matter!”

Me: “In keeping with what Y said, I think it is shocking that people refuse to admit there is a race problem in this country. If you look at any measure of well being: Life expectancy, incarceration, employment, literacy, infant mortality, percentage of the prison population, average wealth, and many other indicators, black Americans are worse off than white Americans. You either believe there is something inherent to blackness which generates these problems, a hypothesis that is literally racist, or you acknowledge that our governmental and social institutions are routinely and predictably disadvantaging people of higher melanin concentration. Once you acknowledge that, you have to ask yourself what you’re prepared to do to help. And, as for all lives mattering, (this might sound familiar) imagine there were two different colored roses…(you guys know how this goes).

B: “Okay fine, so what would you have us do?”

C: “Yea, it’s easy to complain, what solutions do you propose?”

J: “I think the demonstrations are find, but just talking about it or raising awareness will not do anything. I guess I disagree with the demonstration because I just don’t see the value ultimately. It seems like just making a scene for no reason. There really is no need to just sit around and talk. What is there to do?”

S: “Well, wait. Just because Juannell might not be able to readily suggest solutions doesn’t mean the problems aren’t real. It seems you guys are inquiring about solutions as a way to disqualify very real grievances, and that’s not fair.”

Me: “Well, I think we need to integrate our country. We need to know each other. The media can perpetuate terrible stereotypes about black people because most people don’t know any. If someone told me something about negative about C, I would be skeptical because I know C and I think he’s a decent guy. Much the same way, people would be less likely to accept negative depictions of African Americans if they knew some. Moreover, if black people were your neighbors and friends, you’d feel more intimately connected to their plight and you’d be less likely to dismiss it because it didn’t directly affect you. We need to intertwine our legacies in this country. We don’t need neighborhoods to be more colorblind, we need them to be more colorful. Also, how about some wealth redistribution and more equitable resource allocation…”

B(interrupting): “All that stuff that seems so forced and I feel like it can’t just be done. For example, in the 1960s, they tried to integrate and there were riots.”

Me: “Sure, it may be uncomfortable. Hell it may even be chaos. But respecting human dignity means being willing to take risk to make our society better. People will always make the claim that change will make things worse; in this instance that may even be true in the short-term. But a sincere look at what kind of nation we are, and how that differs from what kind of nation we claim to be and moreover what kind of nation we would like to become, I think, should make us willing to take those risk and be willing to deal with short-term discomfort. We can’t just keep saying to historically abused groups that they need to wait for the right time. People said the same things about about ending slavery. They said if we ended slavery there would be problems.”

C: “When we ended slavery there was problems!”

Me: So, um, would you suggest we had kept it?”

C: “That’s not what I meant.”

Me: “What did you mean?”

Y: “That’s racist. Like I can’t even continue with this conversation.”

B: “This is my point: I feel like the media uses these stories as distractions from the other more important things going on in the world.”

Professor: “Like?”

B: “Well there’s what’s happening in France. Isis is gaining momentum, and other things like that, that we need to focus on, but we aren’t because all our attention is on these events that people who insert race into everything use to distract us.”

Me: “I’m not sure what’s happening in France, I’ll admit that. But with respect to this ISIS concern of yours...what’s your biggest fear? That they will gain strength and kill Americans? If that’s it, I’d really love to bring to your attention this other thing that’s currently happening that’s killing Americans. That you could say focusing on a trend of unarmed people being killed by police is a distraction, suggests to me that you really do not think black lives matter. People are dying and your suggestion is that we should focus on something that could potentially kill people because the deaths that have already happened are not worthy of attention? I am now more in support of the tableaus around campus than I was when this conversation initially started.”

Professor: “Guys, I just think of the black community in this country, living under constant occupation. The thought that at anytime they can be made vulnerable to authorities for no reason other than their race does not sit well with me. It is, to me, a fairly obvious indicator that there is a race problem in this country.”

P.S. Independent of what you did or didn’t take away from this shared conversation, there is always an important question left...why are conversations like this one worth having? What is there to gain by having these conversation. J brought up this concern in the conversation and the flow of the conversation did not address it sufficiently. Next week, I’ll be writing a pointed criticism of one of the most important concepts in social justice initiatives: deliberative theory.
