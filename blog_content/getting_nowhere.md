Title: Why We’re Getting Nowhere

Everyone is frustrated! And they should be. Some are angry that, despite their best efforts, the masses continue to be unresponsive to their pleas for a fairer, more equitable society; further disheartened by the injuries that are perpetuated by that unresponsiveness. Others are simply tired of being lectured at; done with being told they are responsible for the world’s problems, even in their inaction. It’d be unproductive, and condescending, to simply tell each side to get over themselves, and yet that’s the exact tact that each side takes with the other.

If you recall, in the Human Dignity Explained Series, I acknowledged that I subscribe to a variation of Kantian morality. I believe there is much to learn from Kant, one thing particularly pertinent here. Kant often argued that it was the agency of the individual that determined the moral worth of the action undertaken. But many have recognized that good motivations that result in bad consequences cannot be preferable, so their must be more to figuring out the right course of action than just identifying acceptable or even noble motivations. Said more simply, even when you’re acting on the right reasons, you still need to do the right thing.

This is where we are falling short as a society, on **both sides** of the social justice arena.

The rise of Trump made one thing very clear: in America, most people care most strongly about their own well being. Unless tens of millions of people are visceral racists, a hypothesis I doubt very strongly, though I suspect and have argued that we’re all racist (just not viscerally so), the only way to explain how someone like Trump could be elected is to point to the things he promised: the rival of dying industries, a stop to jobs leaving the country, an America first trade policy, a wall to decrease illegal immigration, a stronger military to eradicate terrorism, and many other appealing things. This list, to many Americans, was sufficient to overlook the very ugly things Trump also said: debasing Mexican immigrants, alienating Muslims, belittling the plight of African Americans, and showing a clear disrespect for women, and other appalling things.

It is not uncommon to hear a Trump voter say something to the effect of “I don’t support all that racist and sexist stuff, I just really believe[d] that he was going to help my situation and I needn’t help. In a vacuum, there is nothing wrong with pure self-interest. It’s very human to look to promote one’s own well-being. But we don’t live in a vacuum. We live in a diverse society where competing interest need to be balanced. This is what many on the right either fail to acknowledge or refuse to accept. Our society only works when all are considered and the well being of the collective is understood as a fundamental value if not the primary goal. Too many are too ready to make large tradeoffs of other people’s rights for the sake of improving their own lot. This model, we are quickly reminded, and history has convincingly demonstrated, is unsustainable.

But the left is not innocent.

The left has fallen in love with considering themselves the heroes. And where there are heroes, there must be villains. Many on the left have begun to believe that because they are acting to forward the interests of the marginalized and oppressed that they are also immunized from criticism. To disagree at all with message or method is to be bigot. That’s equally unsustainable. Communicating ideas convincingly is the only way forward. Otherwise we are not a society making itself better; we become factions at war. Think about it, if you actually believe that one side has all the power, money, influence, institutional advantage, etc., do you really want to go to war with them?

But please don’t understand me to be chastising the left. I understand how we’ve gotten here. When you truly care about something, the indifference of others, even when that indifference is not malicious, can be infuriating. Especially when that indifference makes those individuals complicit in allowing the injustice that motivate the anger to continue. It can even appear (and sometimes it is the case) that the indifference is malicious and that only further fuels the righteous-indignation fire. But the fact is that in a democracy things are accomplished through interest convergence and coalition building. And on the right I understand that the hostility and villainization from the left can be very uninviting. But what you must understand is that it can be hard to play nice when vulnerable populations continue to suffer and that suffering is greeted with indifference or worse yet oppression comparisons. Showing a willingness to care and furthermore to engage for the common good will go along way toward improving dialogue.

It’s no one’s fault and it’s everyone’s fault.

But something has to give.

My hope is that those on the right will realize how interconnected our destinies are, and that those on the left will realize how few enemies they have. I believe it’s less that so many people are the on opposite team and more that too many people are on the bench.

To the right I say: Get in the game and play for everyone.

To the left I say: Be open to other gameplans.

To all I say: The stakes are too high to be stubborn and hostile. People’s lives hang in the balance.

P.S. I know I’ve been gone a while. But I’m back! See you next week….or the week after that...
