Title: It’s Not About Race
Category: Race
Date: 2015/08/20

Perhaps the single most common rhetorical position amongst race-deniers, is that which explicitly denies race. It is materialize in statements such “this is not a race issue” and also in inquiries as to “why black people make everything about race?”. This position surely lays at the foundation of many of the other arguments I’ve explicitly criticized, and I consider it a personal failing that I have not, until now, criticized the base of much of race-skepticism.

But first…

Let’s be honest: there do exist situations that transpire between actors who are of different races that are best explained by not appealing to racial animous. These situations are not limited strictly to positive interactions which would obviously escape racial animous. Sometimes, at least theoretically, a person may have reasonable fear because of circumstance and not because of race. A black job applicant may be denied a position because she is not qualified and not because the potential employer has chosen to discriminate across racial lines. I have made similar concessions in previous posts; most notably in Oppression is not Subjective,” in which I tried to explain why feeling oppressed was not the same as being oppressed.

What I failed to acknowledge in that post, and what I hope to rectify in the ensuing paragraphs, is acknowledge a central fact that makes the existence of very, very few non-racial charged interactions ultimately irrelevant to the larger conversation of both race and racism in America. And that is: blackness is inherently political.

All race-skeptics and maybe even some self-identified social justice advocates may be confused or annoyed by the suggestion that blackness has an inseparable political element encoding in it. But, a true understanding of the evolution of race in America makes this truth undeniable.

In *The Abolition of White Democracy*, Joel Olson explains both what race is and how it came to be “a form of power that shapes the public space and is shaped by it.” Olson observes that as late as 1660, blacks had still not been degraded to subhuman status in the American consciousness. There we’re property owning blacks (few) and white slaves. Blacks participated in civic life and some even held public office.

The obvious economic value of slavery, however, inspired a perpetual and ferocious boom in the institution. More and more individuals, black and white, were enslaved, some of whom had initially started as indentured servants. As slave numbers began to rise, so did the instances of rebellion. These rebellions were often very destructive, consisting of both black and white slaves intent on securing liberty.

Pressed for a solution, slave states began to generate cleavages. The most obvious, and, as it would be discovered, the most effective, was racial differentiation. Soon, white slavery was outlawed. Blacks who owned property were stripped of it and enslaved. The subjugation of the negro race became the primary goal of slavers. The process of dehumanization was highly successful. This is in large part attributable to a contemporary process of uplifting even the poorest white men. White men were told and came to believe that they occupied a different strata of intrinsic human worth then blacks. This was reinforced by expanding suffrage to all whites; a sign that they were indeed more important than Negroes, who it was argued were not intelligent enough to partake in the democratic processes of civilized men; an obviously ironic contention given blacks had very recently been statesmen.

Alexis De Tocqueville observed that America was an incredibly equal place where whites we’re not hindered in civic life by class. Indeed, argues Olson, that was the tradeoff. An inherited classist society was replaced by a strict racial dichotomy. Slavery was reinforced by a calculated system of racial hate-mongering and deliberate lies as well as mild incentives to whites who were not elite but could think of themselves as the equal of the elites if they accepted the racist fiction. The idea that blackness and whiteness could accurately predict inherent worth over time became an essential feature of the American consciousness. Moreover, white citizenship, and all its privileges ( e.g. voting, fair treatment of the law, not being subject to slavery) was necessarily predicated on the denial of those privileges to other races (this should help you understand why white power and white pride movements are disgustingly ugly things.

When slavery ended, the fiction did not. Attempts to rid the nation of that fiction after slavery’s end during Reconstruction were derailed when the North prematurely pulled out of the south, a political maneuver which secured the presidency of Rutherford B Hayes. The product of this trade was that blackness, though newly liberated, retained all the terrible associations that had been generated for the sole purpose of slavery.

Now, this post could go on about the further trajectory of race in America, but suffice it to say this:

There has never been a consistent, deliberate, and effective movement in America to undo the fiction established in the 17th century. As a result, it has endured. Unsurprisingly, of course, because it provides such comfort to the lowest whites on the American food chain: “life may not be good, but at least we’re not black.” Those in the middle are granted a ready perp for the problems in this country they must deal with, and an easy target for cathartic release. The upper class, enjoying the best life has to offer, both has no need for imagine comforts and has no incentive to upset the established order (unless of course they care about human dignity).

The totality of all I have discussed here is this, to be a black person in America is to live an inherently political existence. There is no time when it is not about race because race predicates their existence in and navigation of this country. Moreover, it is unsurprising that so many white people fail to see race in the everyday workings of society. That is indeed one of the privileges handed to whites by the whites in power during slavery. “By all means,” said the slaver, “don’t worry about race. Look the other way. Pay no attention to the degradation, humiliation, and abuse of your fellow humans.”

P.S. I’m not sure what it would look like to undertake the task of undoing the fiction. I imagine it might start with acknowledging that black lives matter.
