Title: An Invitation to Readers
Date: 2015/1/29
 
When I suggested in my About Me that I wanted this blog to be a learning experience for me, I meant it. With that in mind, I'd like to invite anyone who reads my blog, even if I don't know you personally, to submit a piece to publish on it. YOu can choose your subject and content.
 
I will accept or reject posts on their logical merit and integrity. I am willing to post things I disagree with. This blog is meant to promote the spread of ideas. I'm confident some of you have incredible thoughts. I'd love to share them.
 
Getting involved is simple. Type your piece and email it to me at juannellriley@gmail.com. The opportunity will be open for the Month of February. The best submissions will be featured in March.
 
Looking forward to some great submissions.
 
P.S. I will not post anything dedicated to hate speech, overt racism (not to be confused with differing opinions on race politics) sexism and the like. And secondly I will comment on your piece evaluating your arguments. I will share my comments with you beforehand and you can decide whether or not you'd still like me to publish it. This is actually a real opportunity to voice some intellectual opinions. I hope you will take me up on it.
