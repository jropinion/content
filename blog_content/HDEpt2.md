Title: Human Dignity Explained Part 2: A Reasonable Existence

So, I’ve now explained the ins and outs of what I take to be an understandable system of morality. But I also acknowledged that morality is a choice. Sure, the warm fuzzy feeling morality may provide to some may be enough of a reward in and of itself to motivate some to undertake what I called a moral existence. 

But for some of us, myself included, the perfect moral existence is not possible, and if it were possible would not be desirable. We are pulled by our selfishness, tempted by opportunity, comfortable in our privilege (even when we won’t admit we have it). An existence unhindered by morality just seems like too much fun. It’s almost hard to imagine why anyone would indulge in moral behavior when it would compromise their immediate or long-term enjoyment. Hell, much of human history suggests that this is exactly how humans are motivated, so who could fault a “bad guy” for following the precedent set forth by countless generations.

From John Locke, who suggested good behavior was God ordained, to Thomas Hobbes, who suggested that we needed to sacrifice to survive, to Susan Estrich, who asked us to look closely at how our actions affect others, to John Rawls, who suggested fairness mandated we consider others: all these people and many others tried to find comprehensive ways to tell us to play nice because they were very aware of the incredible temptation for us not to.

Societies like the kwakiutl convince me that humans are not inherently selfish or, if we are, that we can overcome that selfishness. On the other hand, societies like ours make me think that such a transformation is not easy or forthcoming.

Even still, society mandates, if it is to function (shoutout to social contract theorists), that even if we are uninterested in a moral existence, we at least need to observe a reasonable one. 

Most of us agree. 

The obvious proscriptions: there can’t be an unregulated use of violence, there can’t be theft, and there can’t be fraud. If these three things were allowed we would not be able to trust one another and thus we couldn’t live in close proximity to one another, work together, or make deals - things necessary for society by definition. I don’t mean to say this underlies why we make a government, I’m simply saying that this kind of conditioning influences how we act, even in spaces where the government can’t reach us and in societies, past and present, that had/have no formal government to appeal to.

The funny thing about contracts is they occur between parties. This observations suggests that a reasonable existence, understood as an existence that adheres to the implicit social contract I’ve alluded to, might place some other obligations on individuals. After all, there has to be some incentive for people to agree. For some, that incentive may be the opportunity to create wealth; maybe the guarantee that basic needs will be taking care of. My point is, if the contract only asks people to give then, few would be willing to “sign” it.

A reasonable existence, then, must require that no segment of people are oppressed on the basis of their skin color, gender, or some other factor outside of their control. A reasonable existence, then, must require that people be allowed to associate with and love whomever other consenting adult they want. A reasonable existence, then, must require that people be able to chart their own path to spirituality or avoid such an endeavor altogether. A reasonable existence, then, must require that social mobility be more than empty rhetoric.

Why?

Because no one would agree to the opposite. No one would give up natural freedoms if it meant giving up meaningful happiness.

Perhaps you are unaffected by such sympathetic reasoning. You may say to yourself, why should I care? Society works fine for me and it’s not my problem if it doesn’t work for other people.

Good point.

But to that I say, if you are unwilling to uphold your end, why would you expect others to hold up theirs. Why would one not steal, commit fraud, use violence freely If society has failed them? What reasons does any marginalized individual have to not to come to your house and murder the shit out of you and take your stuff. You may say, that’s wrong. By what standard? Morally? You don’t have the patience for that. Reasonable existence? If you believed in that we wouldn’t be in this situation.

All that is left is to acknowledge our shortcomings and revamp our society so it begins to be more in line with one that is filled with reasonable existences.

P.S. I hope this post adequately shows the difference between a reasonable existence and a moral one. It should also be clear why morality is so important. Morality, as I have explained it, is simply the correct guidelines by which to treat humans. Reasonableness is the extent to which we can be expected and are obliged to adhere to those guidelines.
