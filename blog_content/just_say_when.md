Title: Just Say When

“We consider the underlying fallacy of [Plessy's] argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.” *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896)

Racism-skeptics and deniers, in 1896 and now, often suggest that America’s race problem would be fixed if Black people stopped playing the race card. Some bolder observers go as far as to suggest that the entirety, or most, of the racism black people perceive is just that; a perception. They contend that our society has rectified its past racist ways and has since, except where a bad apple is found, distributed resources and hardships equally, for the most part, according to merit.

Now, despite what the opening quote may suggest, this is not an essay about *de facto* segregation, though I believe that it is the single most important factor in racism’s perpetuation. This post, instead, is simply meant to pose a question I think is fair to all those who would suggest racism has ended and the perceived racism in our society is mostly a product of bad apples and the overactive imaginations of black people.

But first….

I think context is important here. I know I risk alienating some of the intended audience with this post by bringing up American, historical moral shortcomings, but I think my question can only be fairly posed by explaining why it’s important first. I promise to keep this section brief.

After the Civil War, and the consequent end of slavery, the defeated South, as one of its first orders of business, begin reconstructing slavery. Through the Black Codes, private violence, economic discrimination, and systemic incarceration, blacks were quickly forced back into servitude. When the North occupied the South, some good was accomplished, but a deal to secure the Rutherford B. Hayes presidency, resulting in the North withdrawing from the South, left blacks again vulnerable to the malice of southern racism. It was during this time, post-reconstruction, that segregation, fueled by hate and white-supremacy, was enacted throughout the South and in parts of the North.

As we all know, things stayed this way until the civil rights movement of the mid 20th Century. At that time black people and white allies  sacrificed employment, injury, and, for far too many, their lives, necessary costs to topple an intransigent legal racial caste system. The sacrifices were not in vain, however, as the resulting civil and voting rights legislation and contemporary jurisprudence (shout out to *Brown* and *Cooper*) enshrined in our laws a sense of equality foreign to America’s founding principles and to some extent still in competition with them today.

At this point we’re at 1966. 50 years ago. So my question: when, in the last 50 years, you know, if racism is over, did racism end? When did the slave-owning, slavery-reconstructing, race-segregating, Jirm Crowing, violent America of the past rid itself of the racist infirmity that enabled it to commit such atrocities to begin with? After all, legislation is merely meant to disable people from following through on their racist inclinations. It can’t strip people of those mental biases. And, from what history has shown, America has been willing to harm black people to the exact extent the law allows and sometimes beyond that without recourse.

Add to that that our media reinforces our most negative stereotypes of one another and, thanks to *de facto* segregation*, those awful misrepresentations of people and their cultures are all we have to go on because so few of us actually know a sufficient number of people of other races intimately if at all. Understand further that this is not a question aimed at the sentiments of White Americans. At no point did most of the racist in this country think they were doing anything wrong. Whatever date one chooses, I’m expecting there to be some evidence of a great improvement in the condition of black people or a demonstrable trend toward such improvement.

I struggle to see how one can believe that racism has ended. Ignoring the current events around us which routinely feature an unarmed assaulted black person, statistics about disproportionate black poverty, the poisoning of disproportionately minority cities, the continued mass-incarcerations of black and brown Americans, the rise of a fear-mongering racist in national presidential politics, granting that racism only plays a factor in those happenings because “the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it; I just want to know when did racism end? Just give me the year or span of years when there was for, the first time in American History, less racism than racism in this country.

P.S. This is not a rhetorical question.
