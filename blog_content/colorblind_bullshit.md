Title: Colorblind Bullshit
Category: Race
Date:2015/10/29

A newly acquired friend of mine, perhaps trying to enhance our relationship, said to me, unprovoked, “I don’t see you as black, ya know? I see you as just a person.” When he said it, I responded, “No thanks. I am black, and you should see me as such.” I can’t be sure of what motivated him to say this, but my guess is that he wanted me to know that he wasn’t racist. Actually, I think all people who subscribe to this colorblind bullshit hope that such a stance will show they are not racist. Their logic, though misguided, isn’t crazy. If you don’t see race, how can you use it to discriminate?

In other posts, I’ve often taken subtle, or not so subtle, shots at the colorblind hypothesis. But, this friend’s comments (because I think he’s well-meaning good guy) revealed to me the urgency of dealing with this terribly mistaken idea.

To begin, not all colorblind subscriptions are motivated equally, though they are all detrimental. I think the colorblind hypothesis exists on a spectrum. On one side there are those people who, like my friend, mean well. They invoke colorblindedness to relay the message that they treat all people equally. This nobly motivated foolishness does indeed communicate a strong message: “I am really racist and I wish I wasn’t.” That may seem like a jump, but I think it’s a pretty easy conclusion to come to.

Consider what my friend said to me; there are only so many ways to understand his words and all the possible interpretations do seem to suggest a pretty high amount of racism.

He could mean:

*I see you’re black but I don’t let the stereotypes about blackness that I believe to be true influence how I think of you*.

You may wonder why this interpretation entails the words, “that I believe to be true.” I think they must necessarily be included, or something that conveys a similar sentiment, because without him believing the black stereotypes there would be no reason for him to discern between me as just a person and me as a black person. If he doesn’t think negatively about blackness, it would be fine to just acknowledge my blackness. This is a pretty offensive statement, so maybe he doesn’t mean this. Maybe he means:

*I see you’re black but you’re so remarkable that you transcend the barriers that usually stop me from befriending black people*.

This interpretation rests on his distinction between a black person and a person, as well. Clearly, something about me makes me not black or more than black or importantly different than black to him, and that is clearly something worth noting. In saying this, my friend would be expressing pretty negative views of blackness, while simultaneously hoping to differentiate between my being, in his appraisal, good and my being black. I've addresed this kind of thinking in a previous post (The Black History Myth). You may ask why I assume that he must have something against blackness. Well, if he didn’t have something against blackness, again, the distinction he makes wouldn’t really be necessary, right? Again, pretty racist. Maybe he means:

*I see you’re black but I’m not going to treat you like society tells me I should treat you because I like you.*

Again, this is an obviously racist statement. Some proponents of the colorblind hypothesis may argue that this interpretation, like the others, is mistaken because it leads with a fundamentally wrong assumption: that my friend sees that I’m black. Perhaps, one might argue, if I trusted his statement that he is actually racially colorblind, I’d see that his statement is best understood as meaning:

*I don’t see race and thus I treat all people equally*.

Granted, the words themselves don’t proscribe such an interpretation, but this interpretation is very obviously wrong for one immediately clear reason: HE IS SAYING THESE WORDS TO ME BECAUSE I AM BLACK!!!!!!!

Unless my friend is walking around telling everyone he meets that he doesn’t see them as black, he clearly does see that I am black. Not only that, he is so conscious of my race that he wanted to let me know that he didn’t mind it. Someone who is actually racially colorblind (as if anyone actually exists) would never say they were colorblind because they would never be aware of a need to. Every person they interacted with would just be a person from their perspective and they wouldn’t need to, nor would they be able to, utilize a disclaimer to solidify that fact.

On the other side of the colorblind spectrum you have people who are a lot less nice. These individuals use colorblindedness as an excuse to discriminate or as a justification for racially disparate outcomes. This brand of colorblindedness is often used to attack affirmative action programs and to discredit racial theorists who try to raise awareness of the structural racism that plagues our society. Surely you’ve heard someone say that black people always bring up race (a statement that is obviously contradictory as it acknowledges race before leveling the charge that certain people acknowledge race). This sentiment also takes the form of cries for law and order, and coded language about inner-cities or other non-racial variables. Granted, these statements don’t appeal to race, but they do appeal to factor nearly indistinguishable from race; so strongly correlated that one would be hard pressed to choose an individual randomly that did not belong to the race that “wasn’t being acknowledged.”

Colorblindedness in this mold is very dangerous. It refuses to explicitly acknowledge race while using race to oppress certain segments of the population. Indeed, I think this is exactly what happens in America today. Everyone claims to be colorblind, but when hiring, sentencing, befriending, promoting, policing, and even with respect to when we feel afraid or how quickly we presume guilt, somehow, despite our colorblindedness, black people predictably get the worst treatment. How can that be?

The colorblind hypothesis, in any and every form, asks us to accept a dual, contradictory reality: one in which race is exists only so far as to permit us to identify the groups that we will then alert that race doesn’t exist. I refuse to accept that reality, and you should too. There is nothing wrong with seeing race. The problem only exists when you see race and then make negative assumptions or unreasonable discriminations. Despite what John Roberts may want you to believe, the best way to get past race, is not to stop acknoweldging it. Doing that would only permit the racial injustice that have been created in this country to persist and be reproduced. Fixing race relations, I believe, necessarily involves recognizing that there are different races and that those races, historically and contemporarily, have received drastically different treatment.

Lastly, don't misunderstand me calling my friend racist to mean I think he's a bad guy. For clarification on this post, see my post "Bigots Can Be Nice People."

P.S. I know I was supposed to explain the difference between appreciation and appropriation and being an ally vs being a savior this week. But, as sometimes happens, this post was way more pressing to me. Next week, I’m going to write about something related to this piece that I’m going to call “The Don Lemon Effect.” The aforementioned explanatory post will follow that one (assuming nothing else comes up, which, you know, may happen).
