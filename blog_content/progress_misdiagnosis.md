Title: Progress Misdiagnosis

We have a black president and a black middle class. Formal segregation no longer exists (but certainly no one thinks we are an integrated nation, right?) in our country and slavery is a distant memory. Some people don’t even find it appropriate to call it the slave trade anymore. Women in college outnumber men in college, and the wage gap has shrunk by six to eight cents depending on whose numbers you use. We’ve done it. The racism and sexism that once polluted our society has, through much effort, been removed, and we can now push forward; all of us colorblind all of us gender egalitarians.

The above reasoning is prevalent and dangerous. Past markers of institutional problems have faded, causing many individuals to conclude that those problems have faded as well. I acknowledged last week that progress has been made and unquestionably our society is less racist and sexist than it has been in the past. But, in the past our society was very very very racist and sexist, and now it’s just very very racist and sexist. It is a mistake to give into oppression anxiety and see oppression everywhere. But it is also equally dangerous to make a progress misdiagnosis and see oppression nowhere.

I argued last week that oppression was an objective measurable thing. So, just because you don’t feel like our society continues to marginalize minorities and women, doesn’t mean it doesn’t in fact do so. Our prison are still disproportionately black. Our CEOs are still disproportionately male. Police continue to routinely murder men and women of color and go unpunished. Sexual violence continues to be a serious threat to the physical, mental, and emotional health of every woman and some men. Entrenched poverty, a national problem, continues to disproportionately remain an unshakeable part of the narrative of many minority families. Sex shaming tactics continue to dominate societies attempted control of female bodies, and female reproductive health continues to take a backseat to other considerations. Our society is not fixed.

One can’t help but wonder how such statistically evident, well-documented, well explained phenomena continue to be ignored. Well, on a case by case basis, it is easy to explain away an overwhelming number of incidences which might be oppressive. Maybe that particular women wasn’t qualified for the job, maybe that particular cop was bad, or that particular unarmed black person actually did represent a serious threat to the officer’s health and well-being, maybe that particular black kid didn’t  care enough about school, or that particular women drank too much leaving herself vulnerable. But these unfounded and rather offensive hypotheses crumble when we see case after case of women stagnated in their ascent of the corporate ladder, of overzealous cops, of murdered black persons, of underserved and subsequently underachieving black youth, of women victimized by a predatory individual. It’s not possible to explain these recurring tragedies without appealing to the common variable that the cases share: the race and sex of the individuals. Furthermore, it’s not fair to pretend continue to blame the oppressed for being oversensitive; for being deficient in some way that were they not deficient in that way would magically turn their situation around.

Again, it is highly possible for an individual from a historically oppressed group to mistake an asinine situation for one that reinforces or contributes to their lowered standing in society, and indeed, when this happens it can be harmful to the cause. But the much larger problem in our society, the one that likely contributes to the frequency of oppression anxiety, is this narrative of excessive and sufficient progress. The idea that as a society we have done all we can to dismantle the oppressive forces of the past and it is now solely on the oppressed to improve their lot is the number disruptive agent in social justice discourse; not only because it is unfounded and untrue, but also because it hardens the heart of the unintentional oppressor, it further demeans already oppressed groups, and it stymies any hope of actual progress.

P.S. the sooner we admit that oppression is purely objective and we relinquish our reliance on sentimental pandering, the sooner we can lessen oppression anxiety and falsify progress misdiagnosis.
