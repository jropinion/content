Title: Women Are Sexy

Street harassment is slowly taking its place in the category of identified demeaning practices we’d be better without. Unfortunately, catcalling persists. One of the primary reasons is that some people can’t understand why they shouldn’t do it. They see that some women don’t like it, but to them that’s not justification enough to stop.

That’s odd. If catcalling is ultimately a seduction tactic or mechanism of flattery, which any reasonable proponent of catcalling would have to hold (otherwise they’d be acknowledging it’s harassment and insisting that it was acceptable anyway), then it would seem the proportion of women displeased with it would be enough to kill the practice altogether since the chances for success would be so low. But, there’s also reason to believe this increases how often it happens as men look to increase their opportunities as much as possible to increase the chance of success.

The above reasoning, however, is only relevant if we acknowledge that catcalling is in fact ultimately a seduction tactic, and furthermore grant that it is a permissible one at that. Catcallers and their sympathizers are quick to make this claim.

This is what motivates misinformed statements about the role a woman’s clothing or physical appearance plays in precipitating her own harassment. Harassers suggest, “she wouldn’t dress that way if she didn’t want attention,” or worse yet, they attempt to excuse the entirety of their inhumane behavior because “women are sexy.”

Let’s start with some honesty.

I agree. Women are sexy...and women are also people. In the kind of society I live in, people are more than their sexually stimulating qualities and restricting their value to such is a subversion of their dignity. When harassers catcall women they do two things: they (1) reduce the humanity of women to women’s sexually stimulating qualities, ignoring the other facets of their being (e.g. the all too common human desire for privacy) and (2) they alert women that a stranger who is likely strong enough, and apparently bold enough, to take it, is interested in their sexual vitality. These two facts are true independent of what a woman is wearing, and thus what she is wearing has no bearing on the acceptability of this practice.

My, perhaps archaic, understanding of sexual intimacy is that it requires some level of comfort and unambiguous consent. If that is so, then intimating a desire for sexual intimacy through catcalling with women who have no comfort with you and are likely incompliant with their harassment is never seduction and will likely never be flattering (and even when it is, would you go around punching people in the face just because occasionally a masochist will like it).

Imagine you are wearing very expensive sneakers or jewelry. You take pride in this item. You display it for the world to see because doing so is a part of how you choose to express yourself in our free society. A person substantially larger than you and obviously stronger than you notices the item you adore and have chosen to display. They yell out to you, “nice sneakers!” You thank them and continue on. They ask you your name. “You can’t see why it’s relevant and you’d very much like to avoid a conversation as you are in an area where robbery is common (for women the robbery is rape and the area is this entire disgusting planet) and you’d be best served to move through it quickly. The person is not dissuaded and continues to attempt to get your attention. They begin to move in your direction, their voice getting louder, their tone getting more desperate. They yell again “What? You don’t know how to take a compliment.” They are now close enough to you to touch you and…

It doesn’t matter how this story ends. You were harassed. You perhaps felt reasonable fear. Maybe your harasser didn’t mean to do so, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.

One might suggest you’d be better served not wearing or flaunting that item in places like that. To that suggestion I have three questions. What do you do when you can’t take off the item? What do you do when places like that are everywhere and you can’t avoid them and simultaneously efficiently move between places you need to be? And lastly, even if you could overcome the first two problems, do we really want to live in a world where you have to?

P.S. Harassers...Shut the fuck up!
