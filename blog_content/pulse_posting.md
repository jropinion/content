Title: Impulsive “Pulse” Posting, Orlando
Category: Political Philosophy
Date: 2016/06/16

The blood on Pulse’s dance floor had yet to dry, and already there were an infinite number of articles authored by people confident that they knew sufficient detail to tell you what caused the shooting and what needed to be done going forward to prevent another. Even more ubiquitous were the memes, screenshots, and posts rebuffing a strawman of an opposing explanation and providing in its place there own theory of what precipitated the events, usually so simplistically that it appeared a strawman in its own right.

Some claimed it was just another example of lax gun laws enabling a psychopath to get a gun, others explained that it was actually our failure to appropriately confront ISIS (which would, they say, include referring to the acts as “Radical Islamic Terrorism”) that led to this massacre. For some observers, it was clear that this all was the product of our cultural messaging: either that LGBTQ persons are appropriate/acceptable targets of animus and violence (a message, it is said, replayed and enhanced by the political right) or that masculinity as it has been crafted in American society, taken to a toxic extreme, inevitably leads to violent outbursts.

There are many other hypotheses, each with their relative strengths and weaknesses, some more compelling (and more likely correct) than others, but all perhaps having some level of resonance with the actual causes of the unfortunate events in Orlando.

But what I found surprising (read: disgusting) was not the plethora of explanations, but the lack of diversity of thought within each explanation. Most “takes” on the events posited one or, if I was lucky, two variables that if changed could dramatically reduce the likelihood of another Orlando.

Even more unfortunate was the lack of explanation of the events in Orlando. Was it a mass shooting? A terrorist attack? A hate crime? All of those things and more? Each form of explaining the tragedy brings with it it’s own implications. If it’s a mass shooting then the gun-control hypothesis is privileged. If it’s a terrorist attack, then the  “ Muslim problem” hypothesis does indeed demand attention (even if only to explain that very few Muslims belong to terrorist organizations). If it’s a hate crime, than perhaps those who have fostered hate for this particular group through their rhetoric, associations, and policy proposals should be held accountable, even if just by way of retroactive culpability.

And, if it’s all these things..?

That’s where the robust discussion became perplexingly mute.

But of course, it didn’t stay that way. Soon after the casualty count was finalized, the Orlando shooting, with 49 deaths and slightly more than that injured was characterized as the deadliest mass shooting in US history. I’m still not sure what this adds to the narrative. Especially since, as many would explain, Wounded Knee, Rosewood, and other horrific instances in American history dwarfed the casualties in Orlando. I’m also not sure why this matters. Some suggested it matters because it shows a racialized trend of rewriting history. Perhaps. I think it more shows how the way we choose to define things can drastically change our perception of the past and present (expect a post on this idea).

Still, even in this peripheral argument, there was very little balance across perspectives balance. And, more importantly, the atrocity in Orlando was again reduced to no more than a vehicle for the agenda of the speaker, independent of which perspective was being voiced.

Therein lies my grievance with the rhetoric surrounding this whole ordeal: many people aren’t trying to explain what happened in Orlando to prevent it from happening elsewhere, instead, it would appear that the true goal is to show how Orlando proves they were right all along. Granted, this is a cynical thought, but I don’t think it’s that off base.

After all, truly getting to the root causes of an event with as many variables and factors as Orlando is hard to do. And yet, untrained in psychology, unfamiliar with Islam, unacquainted with the substance of actual gun laws, and unwilling to move beyond blatant mischaracterizations of competing opinions, any person with a voice saw fit to put the events in Orlando into a box, and not just any box. Boxes were chosen based on how well they displayed the factors in Orlando the speaker thought was important, the box of course having no room for the factors in Orlando that might undercut the presented narrative.

For example, for those who thought the Christian Right should be blamed for fostering hate of the LGBTQ community, there was no room for the suggestion that maybe Radical Islamic Terrorism played a role, even though the killer pledged his allegiance to ISIS and the attack happened shortly after. Many who saw guns and lax gun laws as the problem were similarly unconcerned with that fact. Hypothesizers seemingly obsessed with the terrorist element, gave little air time to the idea that gay people might be made targets of animus in our country too regularly or that our gun laws might be able to help the problem. The list goes on.

Now, I know compassion, concern, anger, grief, frustration and many other emotions surround this latest shooting. I understand that the desire to make terrorist attacks, hate crimes, and mass shootings things of the pass. But we have to recognize that insisting one narrative holds all the answers is not how progress is made. Being unwilling to acknowledge our biases and blindspots directly contributes to the collective ignorance that allows the criminally insane and the morally bankrupt to exact harm on our fellow humans. Too strong an attachment to anything, be it guns, tolerance, or irrational hate, is going to continue to inhibit progress.

If your conduct suggests the deaths in Orlando were little more to you than a new opportunity to dust off your favorite political, social, or other such arguments for how our society should look or change going forward, then the only difference between you and the Orlando shooter is you didn’t pull the trigger.
