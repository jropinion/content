Title: An Audience Of The Like-minded

Surely we all have had at least some shallow exposure to the idea of filter bubbles. This is the concept that we are, on the internet, and ever more off it, protected from opposing views. This is partly the function of websites delivering us the kinds of advertisements and search results they think we’d most enjoy, part our own obsession with the news sources and entertainment platforms that align with our ideas and values, and part our purposeful removal of those we disagree with from our newsfeeds and our lives.

While we may have little to no control over how websites operate based on our browsing histories, we do have control over what we choose to browse. We can always change our news sources, keeping our favorites while incorporating new, different, if not directly challenging, perspectives. We can also be less quick to unfriend or block those people who we believe have repugnant opinions. We could ask questions about their perspectives. We could talk about our own with them. It can be really civil.

Or, we can continue to isolate ourselves into more and more homogenous safe spaces. We can forego debate altogether, characterizing all those of differing minds as bad people. That approach seems really effective at perpetuating the exact cycles of violence, oppression, and resentment that are at the base of our most combustible disagreements. We seem to have wholeheartedly chosen the latter.

Unfortunately, this phenomenon has two obvious consequences. The one we’re all aware of,  that many of us enjoy, is the constant reinforcement feedback loop whereby you are constantly bombarded by things you agree with and applauded for expressing ideas consistent with those beliefs. It’s become a daily occurrence to see a Facebook friend share an article with a blatantly false or ridiculous premise, that is then liked and commented on approvingly by the same 5-10 people that like and comment on all the rest of the stuff that person shares. This leads directly into the second, much less acceptable consequence.

Filtering out opposing views is making you stupid! 

Necessarily so, actually. Unless, of course, you believe you and your cyber-posse of 50 people have all the answers. If you can admit you guys don’t, then you should also be able to see how shielding yourself from other perspectives might lead to you having deeper and deeper convictions about more and more extreme ideas, your thoughts resembling reality less the deeper down the rabbithole you go.

 I’m realizing more and more that both liberals and conservatives, and everyone else, think they have the right normative values. But, fortunately, normative values (even those ascertained through religious belief) are so diverse as to make it impossible to not be constantly challenged on that frontier. Information and perspective, on the other hand, can be filtered, expanded or constricted, altered and exaggerated or simply misstated. And if all one’s information is coming from the same kinds of sources, then there is nothing to correct for that filtering, exaggeration, etc.

Through this process, we are becoming stupider. More stubborn. More diluted into believing that our way of understanding a particular phenomenon is the only way of understanding said phenomenon. 

Why do I care?

Well, as I’ve tried to consistently bring up: PEOPLE’S LIVES AND DIGNITY  ARE AT STAKE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS.

Seriously, let’s stop avoiding those who disagree with us. The truth is, we’re not afraid they’ll say something bigoted. We’re afraid they’ll say we’re wrong, and that they’ll be right. And when you’ve built an identity and found purpose in a particular fight or cause, hearing you might be approaching it from an ineffective angle, or that there is no fight to fight at all, is very unsettling.

But...isn’t that the point? Aren’t we trying to find the way to organize our thoughts and beliefs that leads to a more equitable society for all. Why would your own beliefs be immune from that reorganization?

P.S. They’re not!
