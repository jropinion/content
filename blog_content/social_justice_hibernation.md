Title: Social Justice Hibernation

The social justice fight should not be a some-of-the-time fight. And yet advocacy for particular issues is strongly correlated with polarizing events. People care so much about racism after an unarmed black person is killed or after a famous person says something racist. But, as the news coverage of those particular events subsides, so does the outrage; so does the concern and empathy.

Perhaps sustained, organized efforts were easier in the past because social maladies like slavery, segregation, unequal voting privileges, and underwhelming legal protection for certain groups were ubiquitous and easily identifiable. In earlier years there was no question that blacks were oppressed, that gay people were persecuted, and that women were marginalized. But, as the mechanisms of oppression, persecution, and marginalization have become more subtle, it seems the imperative to act has been jeopardized.

In “All Quiet on the LGBTQ Front”, I talked about the need to not be pacified by victories, no matter how substantial, because of how much work there remains to be done. It is equally important that we not let the deceptiveness of oppression in the modern day relax our desire to see true justice prevail.

Of course, there are a multitude of excuses people have to explain their marginal fickle passion for social justice. Of those reasons, three are particularly common. Of those three, none are sufficient to justify the inconsistent attention these important issues receive form all but the most dedicated of social justice advocates.

###**Understanding these issues is difficult.**

This is a simple concern. And, as such, it requires a simple solution. Go out and learn about them. Read blogs, political theory, articles; watch videos. Many really smart people have dedicated their lives to explaining the most complex social mechanisms of oppression (unfortunately many other smart people have dedicated their lives to denying them). These explanations and analyses are easy to find. Just as easy as finding streaming links for your favorite tv show you watch illegally on your computer. These issues are important enough that you owe it to your fellow human to go and look!

###**The polarizing event (the police murder, the racist comment, the discriminatory policy) is the only thing worth focusing on.**

This is a common mantra amongst those people who still deny the institutional, structural nature of racism and other forms of bigotry. These individuals see isolated incidences of injustice and look to provide justice in those particular instances. When a cop kills and unarmed black person, for example, this person worries primarily about the punishment the cop recieves the and efforts made on behalf of the State to rectify the loss suffered by the family, to the extent that is possible.

The problem with this position is that it overlooks the fact that some injustice happen to certain communities disproportionately, and with startling frequency. To continue to isolate every episode of a women being sexually assaulted or a black person being extrajudicially murderd by an agent of the State would necessarily require ignoring the historical context informing the incident and pertinent social facts surrounding the case. There is a overarching scheme of social entitlement to women’s body and devaluation/under-appraisal of black bodies, which makes women more likely to be raped and a black person more likely to be murdered (both by police but also by private citizens).
And, even if this weren’t true, limiting one’s advocacy and interest to the current polarizing event and then hibernating until the next is a self-defeating approach. Looking for common themes in similar cases allows one to identify potential solutions to eliminate the phenomenon from our society...or at least make it less prevalent. Also, meaningful reform will likely only occur in the interim between polarizing events (you know, because during the polarizing event people are, well, polarized).

###**Thinking about these issues all the time is exhausting.**

This excuse for feeble social justice efforts actually resonates with me quite strongly. Constantly looking at the social mechanism of oppression is exhausting...and depressing, disheartening, upsetting, infuriating, and the list goes one.

You know what’s worse?

Perpetually living in the confines of those mechanism. While it is true that uprooting racism, sexism, homophobia and the like is the equivalent to moving mounds of rubble, when there are people trapped under that rubble, being tired stops being a good excuse. And, if we all dedicated ourselves to moving rubble, there would be less rubble to move and less exhaustion as a result. The social justice fight isn’t inherently or necessarily exhausting. The social justice fight is difficult as a direct result of the fact that not enough people care; there aren’t enough volunteers to remove the rubble. Hell, some people don’t even know the building has fallen.

P.S. I am always willing to talk to any person looking to take a more active role in understanding how our society functions to oppress. I am also enthusiatic to talk to anyone who thinks oppressive mechanisms are not a feature of our society. For individuals in either group, email, facebook, or a comment below will suffice.
