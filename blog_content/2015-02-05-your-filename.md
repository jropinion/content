Title: The Black History Myth
Category: Race
Date: 2015/2/5

It’s obvious why black history month exists. It’s not an insidious plan by the powers that be to limit the study of black culture and the historical impact of black people to one month. It’s a deliberate effort to set time aside to recognize black individuals whose stories have been demeaned, marginalized, and ignored; it’s an attempt to give attention to alternate narratives and highlight overlooked details. A beautiful goal. And yet, I couldn’t hate black history month more.

Make no mistake about it, I love learning about the achievements of men and women who share my melanin concentration. It’s a wonderful reminder that despite societies covert message about the limits placed on me by my blackness, I can affect the world, what I do does matter, and when I’m gone someone may care.

My problem with black history month is simple: black history doesn’t exist. There is no alternate reality where Ford invented cars that is separate from the reality where Garrett Morgan invented the stoplight. Rosa Parks did not refuse to give up her seat on the bus in a vacuum. This list could go on, but it would be entirely more effective to explicitly state the problems the concept of black history introduces.

###**The Black Vacuum**

I’ve already hinted at this problem but it’d be helpful to elucidate. Black history, both conceptually and in its promulgation, implies that there is some separation or key difference between it and history *simplicter*. History, we are taught, is all the advances and failures, quarrels and unions, discoveries and destructions of the white man. History starts in Europe and ends when western democracy permeates the world. There are, of course, special shoutouts to the white Ancient Egyptians (wherever the fuck they came from) and white Jesus in the Middle East.

While history was happening, black history also happened. This is all the stuff going on in Africa before the Slavers arrived. Somehow slavery is omitted from black history (perhaps because we need to stop focusing on it so much? It was 150 years ago after all and things have been phenomenal since). Black history again reconvenes in the 1960s, when, out of nowhere, all these black people got really smart and really qualified to do stuff. There were marches and firehoses and a Supreme Court Justice (shoutout to Thurgood). The civil rights period ends and black history stops existing again until 2008 when Barack Obama is elected president and America becomes a post-racial society (yay!).

To me, this history seems a little incomplete. What were black people doing in the 1980s and 1990s? Seeing a rise in a black middle class as the nation experienced renewed economic growth. What were black people doing in the 1920s and 1930s? Probably being devastated by the Depression. What were black people doing in the latter half of the 1800s? Probably attempting to adjust to their newly granted freedom while simultaneously dealing with the chains of segregation and marginalization from formal economic activity, hoping to find stability in a nation that was recently ravaged by civil war.

The thing is, black people were there in history: suffering, contributing, living.

###**Ignoring the White Impact**

Related to the black vacuum is the removal of the white impact. By this I mean that the concept of black history allows some to ignore the causal relationship of the past events of whites on blacks and that of blacks on whites. I’ve already mentioned how slavery is ignored in large part, sometimes not even getting a chapter of its own in textbooks. But more importantly, when we talk about black history as MLK marching, Rosa sitting, Malcolm rallying, and Nat King Cole singing we ignore some of the correlative events: whites enslaving, white’s segregating, whites assassinating, and whites marginalizing. What we call black history would be better characterized as a narrative of a group of people identifiable by common skin tone routinely combating the forces of white oppression.

Much like black people were there for history, white people were there for “black history.” Ignoring the inseparable connection between the two undermines any attempt to actually record an accurate record of past events - which is what I’ve always taken to be the goal of history.

###**The Noble Black Person**

Lastly, and perhaps most insidiously, the way black history is narrated is very misleading. Black history seems to only have heroes. Black history’s study creates a strong dichotomy between the noble black person (e.g. Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, MLK, Rosa Parks, Barack Obama ) who is worth discussing and the rest of those blacks who we needn’t discuss. It suggests that there is something exceptional about these individuals that helps them transcend their blackness. We don’t learn about the historical trajectory of blacks as much as we learn about the exceptional deeds of people who happened to have been black. 

What I want instead of black history, is a complete narrative of the trajectory of the black person throughout history intertwined with the history of human development because SPOILER ALERT!!!!! black people are in fact human; a history that doesn’t overlook failures and setbacks. I want a real history and that can only happen if we move past the hold of “black history” and place the black narrative where it belongs: with all the other human narratives about the past.

P.S. Black History Month being the shortest month...are you fucking kidding me?
