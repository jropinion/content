Title: Hip-hop Causes Deaths
Category: Race
Date: 2015/04/16

It has become almost inescapable; the desire to somehow blame blacks for the incessant killing of black people (predominantly men) at the hands of law enforcement while simultaneously excusing cops of all culpability routinely generates tacitly racist arguments. One example of such thought trumpeted by race deniers lately is the idea that somehow rap and hip-hop music are to blame.

The argument goes something like this: hip-hop music both glorifies crime and inspires disrespect and contempt for law enforcement. Music/media influences our actions greatly. As a result, hip-hop music creates criminals. This leads to more interactions with cops. These interactions tend to be more hostile because hip-hop engenders a disrespect for cops. This leads to more resistance and aggression forcing law enforcement officers to defend themselves; often leading to increased instances of justified assault and occasional necessary murders.

I think this is a fair construction of the argument. And, there is a problem with perhaps every sentence of it.

###Hip-hop music glorifies crime and inspires disrespect and contempt for law enforcement

This idea is a mistake. Sure, some hip-hop music discusses crime and some hip-hop music expresses anti-law enforcement sentiments, but to group all of hip-hop into that category is completely unfair. That would be like reducing all country music to just those songs which praise outlaws like Jessie James, a notorious gang leader and criminal, or that treat women like sexual objects or prizes to be won. Surely the genre of country music is richer than just those songs, and the same is true of hip-hop. Furthermore, I imagine those who would promulgate this argument don’t listen to hip-hop and thus are probably not experts on its content. That might at least suggest that one should be a tad bit more hesitant when excusing the murders of unarmed individuals by agents of law enforcement given their limited understanding, right?

###Music/media influences our actions greatly. As a result, hip-hop music creates criminals

To an extent, of course we’re influenced by music and media. But, sufficiently to inspire individuals to jeapordize their lives? I’m skeptical of that claim. Historical oppression and economic hardship, on the other hand, tend to produce criminality and a disrespect for the power structure which has and continues to reinforce that disparate predicament. It’s not impossible that people extract their values from music and media. It’s likely. It’s just far more likely that poverty and need inspire people to commit crime, and a long history of abuse and repeated extrajudicial murders generate contempt for law enforcement. Furthermore, are cops not people? Can we not assume on this same line of reasoning that perpetual portrayals of blacks as troublemakers, dangerous, and somehow superhuman in strength have created in cops a somewhat unreasonable fear of blacks? Isn’t it possible that cops are coming into these interactions with biases that make the situation worse? Why should we focus so heavily on the non-murdering side of the equation? We should be figuring out ways for cops to not murder, not for black people to not get murdered.

###These Interactions tend to be more hostile because hip-hop engenders a disrespect for cops. This leads to more resistance and aggression forcing law enforcement officers to defend themselves
This is perhaps the most insulting and infuriating idea. To assume that there would be fewer murders if people would just be more complicit in their oppression is to be completely insensitive to the plights of marginalized groups and completely oblivious to the nature of these interactions. This idea is especially dangerous because it is codified into our laws. We ask whether the officer feared for his life, never once inquiring if the black man, fully aware of the likelihood that his interaction with a cop, even if he is innocent, might lead to bodily injury and potentially death, fears for his life. We don’t ask if the black woman, aware she is assumed crazy, fears for her life. We only ask if the officer, who can, and often does, precipitate a hostile environment, sensed hostility. Worse yet, we have set the bar so incredibly low for what it means for an officer to fear for his life that unarmed men can be killed. How poorly are we picking and training our officers that unarmed men and women represent serious threats to their lives; that men and women who are fleeing away from them represent threats to their lives; that men and women with their hands up represent threats to their lives; that pill bottoms represent threats to their lives; that fucking children represent threats to their lives?

###Often leading to increased instances of justified assault and occasional necessary murders

By now it should be obvious that this is a bad, unfounded premise. It assumes the many assaults and murders are justified. And, for the argument to make sense, it has to. Even if hip-hop did all the arguer would suggest it does, that would mean nothing unless the murders are ultimately justified. But, the arguer has given no reason to believe the murders are justified. Are they justified because hostile individuals deserve to be murdered? Are they justified because police have unlimited leeway to deal with suspects (keep in mind none of these people received trials and thus can’t be rightly called criminals)? To ultimately conclude these murders are justified, understandable, or anything else other than wrong because of hip-hop seems to make some inconspicuous connection that is not apparent and likely not true. It is this conclusion that I believe ultimately reveals this line of argumentation to be the racist rhetoric it is.

But let’s assume the argument is true. It still doesn’t explain the disproportionate extrajudicial murders of black individuals throughout this country.

Why?

BECAUSE WHITE PEOPLE LISTEN TO HIP-HOP!!!!!!!

I have many white friends from all different socioeconomic classes and geographic regions who listen to rap and hip-hop. Yet none of them find themselves in a position with authorities where they may lose their lives often. Why the difference? Are they smarter and thus know how to appreciate the music as just music, something a black person is incapable of doing? Are they just naturally more civil and able to better resist hip-hop’s poisonous influence? Maybe they wear the perfect cops-don’t-kill-me outfits. The only variable that seems different to me is that they are white.

I’m also wondering on what basis we are assuming that all these black individuals listen to hip-hop. Are we that bold as to blatantly stereotype while we posit racism doesn’t promote animus?

The idea that hip-hop is the ultimate culprit in the many murders of unarmed black individuals at the hands of cops is a logical nightmare. It looks to establish causality through a fairly weak correlation based on a misinformed viewpoint while ignoring other similar correlations. In other words, it’s quite blatantly racist and quite obviously wrong; It’s just another way of ignoring the fact that black lives matter.

P.S. One also hears that black on black crime somehow makes these murders okay. But I think that idea is just as poorly founded. Next week I’ll pick apart that foolishness.
