Title: Human Dignity Explained Part 3: A Dignified Existence
Category: Political Philosophy
Date: 2015/3/12

I concluded the last post by suggesting that the supposed necessity of adhering to a reasonable existence was enough to convince the masses to consider the dignity of others. But, I’m not sure that’s true.

Some people, unconvinced by my appeal to morality and further unmoved by the idea of a reasonable existence may stand fast in their opposition to “social justice.” They may say: “If people won’t follow the laws and go with the social mores that have made me wealthy and powerful, then we can just remove them from society.” This may seem controversial but consider the size of the United States prison population, and more importantly, consider it’s composition. Despite most the population being White, most of the prison population is not. This suggests, perhaps, that people have in large part adopted this kind of thinking: removing unruly segments of the population from society, forgoing finding solutions to their criminality in favor of quarantining the “bad people.”

You may see nothing wrong with this. Criminals should go to jail. That is the mantra that we’ve abided by since we doubled down on a law and order society 35 years ago. No longer do we take a substantive look at the cause of crime and launch our vengeance at that. We avoid the important questions: like whether our society generates a class of criminals by allowing some to compile so much wealth that others have no meaningful opportunity at doing the same; like whether we marginalize individuals on the basis of race, sex, sexuality, etc, leaving little opportunity for success through designated legitimate avenues; like whether we treat individuals as such, or whether entire groups are left to fend for themselves.

And why should you care?

Dignity, best understood, is the state of being where something is able to exist in its purest, uninhibited form. Without true equality of opportunity there is no dignity for anyone.

For example, in a society where marriage equality is denied to some, any marriage is not only a symbol of love, it is also a grotesque display of institutional power. It is an indicator of status; of belonging to the identified class of people whose love is seen as legitimate. In a society where not all love is validated, any validated love is also a status symbol; is also tainted. A marriage in such a society is diminished in value, because marriage in that society is obviously not simply a marker of love. 

The same goes for personal achievement. If our social institutions are setup such that some individuals have their access to resources of all types diminished by our unchecked, unacknowledged biases, then all who have access are also marked as superior. One’s accomplishments are cheapened by the the fact that there wasn’t a fair race. All success is denigrated by the same asterisks that pollutes the world of sports when athletes use steroids (and there is no steroid like being a straight, white man).

This thought experiment could be repeated *ad nauseum*, but the point is simple. Until our society takes the dignity of every individual seriously, until our society relinquishes the use of laws to directly oppress some and provide excuses to remove others, until our society is fair, there is no dignity for anyone.

So, going forward, when I remark about the importance of human dignity, what I am alluding to is the interconnected relationship between all segments of humanity; the undeniable truth that as people we deserve a certain kind of treatment. I’m won’t mean that morality dictates it, though it does. I won’t mean that our society can’t function without it, though it can’t. I’ll mean that without a serious reflection of the impact of social choices and attitudes on the predicaments and dignity of all, our society fails everyone. Simply put: “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
