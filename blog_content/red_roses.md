Having trouble understanding why #alllivesmatter is an inadequate replacement for #blacklivesmatter? Well, after you read this, I promise it will be clear. But only if you remain persistent and read to the end.

Imagine there are two gardens. One with white roses and one with red roses. Each garden is looked after by a different gardener. The gardener who looks after the red rose garden is experienced and loving. As long as she has been alive she has tended to her garden. The gardener who looks after the white roses only recently began gardening. He has a relative who gardens, but he doesn’t really talk to her anymore. Their relationship was ruined when he told her that he wouldn’t let her run the garden, which upset her because that was their initial agreement. 

The white rose gardener without resources, and afraid his garden would fail, went to the red rose gardener for help. The red rose gardener was nervous about the white rose gardener’s request, but decided to help anyway. While the red rose gardener was in her shed, the white rose gardener stole some of the red rose seeds. He knew that he could use the red roses to cultivate the soil, which would keep him from having to waste any of his own seeds. When the red rose gardener returned, the white rose gardener thanked her and left.

The white rose gardener planted the red rose seeds in the dry, untilled soil. He didn’t water the red roses well, afraid he would deplete the water supply for his white roses. He made sure, however, that the red roses got plenty of sun. He noticed the red roses didn’t grow very well. He thought to himself, “these red roses are not as good as the white roses, that much is obvious.” But, he was pleased with the way the red roses transformed the soil. So pleased, he decided to visit the red rose gardener again with the hopes of stealing more seeds.

When he arrived, he couldn’t help but notice the red rose garden looked slightly less nice than it did when he first visited. He asked the red rose gardener for more help, hoping she would go to her shed so he could swipe some more seeds. But the plan didn’t work this time. The white rose gardener, becoming impatient, threatened the red rose gardener. When she didn’t budge, the white rose gardener began to savagely beat her. He took as many seeds as he wanted and walked through her garden at his leisure, claiming portions of it for himself. Along with the seeds, he took soil and other equipment back to his garden. The attack on the red rose gardener left her bedridden, unable to care for her ravaged garden for sometime. During that time, her garden fell into chaos. Flowers went unwatered, the soil hardened; soon the once beautiful garden was no longer recognizable as such.

The white rose garden, on the other hand, with the help of the red rose seeds and the new soil and equipment, flourished. Soon, the white rose gardener was growing beautiful white roses. Eventually, the white rose gardener had a son. As the son aged, he couldn’t help but notice that his dad did not care for the red roses adequately. His dad didn’t water the red roses sufficiently; his dad only planted red roses in dry, untilled soil; and his dad seemed to care for the white roses more, often spending hours grooming the white roses so they looked perfect.

The son, worried for the red roses, brought all the oversights to his dad’s attention. His dad, somewhat embarrassed quickly conjured a bunch of stories. “You see son,” began the white rose gardener, “red roses aren’t as good as white roses. Not only do they not look as pretty, they are also harder to maintain. When you mix them in with the white roses they drink all the water, and worse yet, make pink roses, which are an abomination. Son, the only way to make sure the white roses stay perfect and this garden stays healthy is to keep the red roses weak and separate.”

The son, hearing these stories, developed contempt for the red roses. He hated the threat they represented to the white roses and he vowed he would never let the garden his father worked so hard to build, be overrun by the terrible heathen plants. 

Soon, there was very little rough soil left that needed cultivating. The white rose gardener didn’t know what to do with the red roses. The red roses, for many generations, had only been used to help cure the soil, and now he had no real use for them. He couldn’t let all the seeds go to waste, and he couldn’t stop all the red roses he already planted from reproducing. He decided the best thing he could do was segregate the red roses.

When the white rose gardener died, his son took over as the new white rose gardener. Though he no longer needed the red roses, he loved his garden and they were a part of it. The new white rose gardener would occasionally give some water to the red roses but he only planted them in the worse, most nutrient deprived soil. When he would invest fertilizer in the soil, he would skip over the red rose patches and also omit any white rose patches that were too close to the red rose patches. He marked the areas he would skip over with a red line. As a result, the red roses didn’t grow very strong. Every now and then, a few red roses would grow to the height of the white roses. In these instances, he would put the red roses on display, insisting that those particular red roses were special. Sometimes, he would see pink roses sprout around the edges of the white rose patches. He tried his best to keep that from happening, but soon he was overwhelmed.

Meanwhile, the red rose gardener, now again able to tend to her garden, took to work replenishing it. It was dilapidated and most of the flowers were impoverished in nutrients. She was determined to make her garden better. She went to the new white rose gardener and asked for assistance. He gave it to her, but made sure to chastise her for letting her garden get to such a sad state. She needed the assistance too badly to bring up how the new white rose gardener’s father had caused her plight.

Eventually, the new white rose gardener had a son. His son loved to play in the garden. He loved the white roses, and he thought the pink roses were pretty and exotic. He, however, didn’t understand why the red roses were in such bad shape. His dad told him that the red roses were not as good at extracting nutrients from the soil as the white roses were. Moreover, he pointed to the state of the red rose garden as evidence that the red roses were just naturally like that. The son, initially unconvinced, tried to spend time understanding the red roses. He tried playing in the red rose patches and he got poked by a thorn. The red roses, you see, had developed these thorns overtime as a way to ward off predators, since the new white rose gardener did not tend to them, forcing them to adapt to defend themselves. 

After being thorned, the new white rose gardener’s son developed a silent contempt for the red roses. Though he never acknowledged it out loud, he liked them less and reasoned that the red roses struggled to grow because of their own vices. They didn’t want assistance, he reasoned, because they were thorny, and if they extracted nutrients from the soil better, they’d be fine, even though his dad had purposefully put the roses in the most deficient soil possible and never invested fertilizer.

When the new white rose gardener died, his son became the gardener (the white rose gardener was no longer an appropriate name because the garden now had white roses, red roses, pink roses, and yellow roses that came from other farms due to prevailing winds blowing seeds). The gardener, still filled with animus toward the red roses, continued the practices of his father and grandfather. But, because he did not acknowledge his feelings toward the red roses, his attack on the plants took a more insidious, indirect form.

He made white roses the new standard of beauty, occasionally watering the red roses that resembled the white roses the most, encouraging the reproduction of that kind of red rose. He began building fixtures around the red roses that limited sunlight. He allowed ferrets to roam throughout the red rose patches. He would sometimes forget to water the red roses at all. But, he did slightly improve the quality of the soil. 

The red roses, as a result began to fight (as much as plants fight). The scarcity of resources made the red roses compete for survival. They drank water quickly and pushed against one another for the little sunlight available. This created an even worse state as the little resources available were no longer distributed evenly throughout the red roses. 

The white roses, on the other hand, thrived. Their soil was so rich in nutrients that almost every seed planted grew very tall. To the gardener, this provided confirmation of the bias that had been handed down for generations in his family: white roses are better than red roses.

As his father before him, the gardener had a son. Because the gardener was still young, he let his son go off to school to learn botany, hoping the information learned at university would allow his son to take the garden to new heights.

His son returned from school very excited. The first thing he did when he got back from school is tell his dad that he knew how to fix the red rose population.

“Dad, the red roses need water.”

“Well, duh, son! All roses need water.”

“No, dad, you don’t understand. The red roses are only in this decrepit state because for many generations our family has ignored their needs. We have erected a system in which few red roses can actually grow to their full maturity. I think we can reverse this process. But the first thing we have to do is acknowledge that red roses need water. They need better soil, more sun, and tending. They need to be treated like plants, not like pests.”

“Son,” replied the gardener, “all roses need those things.”

“Dad, please try and understand me. Yes, all roses need those thing, but we haven’t neglected all roses throughout the years. We have systematically deprived the red roses of the essentials for successful plant life. We have treated the other roses fine. The only way to help the red roses be healthy is to recognize our bias against them. We have to admit that red roses need water and we haven’t given it to them. The white roses have water, and they have it because we understand they need it.”

“Why would I give red roses special treatment? All roses need water.”

“Dad, you’re not listening to me. You’re being a monster!”

“If you’re going to call me names instead of presenting your argument then I won’t talk to you.”

“But, dad, red roses need water.”

“Son, all roses need water.”
