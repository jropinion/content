Title: Wealth and Slavery

Despite what the title may imply, this will not be about the impact that slavery, segregation, and other insidious forms of racism have had on the financial trajectory of Blacks in America. That topic is important and essential to both understanding how we ended up with such a resource divide and how we can correct it. On the other hand, the rhetoric surrounding these two topics is highly contradictory. Let me explain:

I am an advocate of large scale redistribution. If we are to fix the race problem, there is a need for attitudinal change in our society, self-determinative efforts in the black community, changes to our laws and institutional structures, and huge changes to the systemic appraisal and treatment of black bodies. But, I think all those things are ultimately moot without the material support and resource allocation necessary to make them effective.

That said, whenever I express this belief I am routinely confronted with one question: “Who’s going to pay for it?”

My response seldom changes. We will. You will. I will. That guy will. Solving century old problems can’t be a task taken up by a small few. 

This reasoning, however, is often ineffective. For starters, the person I’m talking to is probably a skeptic about whether or not there is a race problem at all. Moreover, even if they admit there is a race problem, they refuse to acknowledge that they had any role in producing it or that they have any role in its maintenance. You may have heard this argument elegantly stated as: “I didn’t own any slaves.”

Facially. this claim is true. There are very few slavers living among us. But the race problem, though finding its genesis in the material greed and indecency of slavery, is no longer entirely reducible to slavery. Decades upon decades of various forms of legal and social discrimination and oppression are every bit as important to understanding the race problem in America as slavery is. Moreover, as I explained in “Bigots Can Be Nice People”, our unconscious biases greatly influence how we interact with people of other races, and on a large enough scale, these disparities in treatment can and do create societal problems that may not be apparent when assessing the actions of one individual.

But here’s the contradiction that bothers me: why is there such a thing as old money in this country? If our ancestors misdeeds do not shackle us with a moral debt to equalize what they have undermined, why is there a moral right to the wealth produced from their efforts, and furthermore, how is it that that wealth is not tainted by the atrocities and injustices that produced it?

If you oppose financial reparative measures on the basis that you did not own any slaves and thus you have no obligation to pay to fix the problems that were caused by slavery and have persisted since slavery (e.g. the material depravity of the blacks in America), you can’t also think that people are entitled to the wealth of their parents. And yet, these two beliefs are simultaneously held by a lot of people; most of whom inherited the material resources to actually effect change from a lineage which generated the problems that need changing.

I imagine the response here would be that one’s hard work justifies excess wealth and once wealth is owned it should be up to the owner of the resources to choose what to do with them; and that choice is usually to pass it on in the form of inheritance. I get that. But let’s be honest, we know that not all wealth comes from hard work. We also know that until the 1980s (some might even say until the 1990s), hard work, for some groups, was more likely to lead to violence directed at them than wealth accumulation. Moreover, our government and many private individuals went to great lengths to ensure that blacks were kept from creating wealth, no matter how hard they worked.

As Ta-Neishi Coates explains in the excellent Atlantic article “The Case For Reparations” (which I implore you to read): 

*“Having been enslaved for 250 years, black people were not left to their own devices. They were terrorized. In the Deep South, a second slavery ruled. In the North, legislatures, mayors, civic associations, banks, and citizens all colluded to pin black people into ghettos, where they were overcrowded, overcharged, and undereducated. Businesses discriminated against them, awarding them the worst jobs and the worst wages. Police brutalized them in the streets. And the notion that black lives, black bodies, and black wealth were rightful targets remained deeply rooted in the broader society. Now we have half-stepped away from our long centuries of despoilment, promising, “Never again.” But still we are haunted. It is as though we have run up a credit-card bill and, having pledged to charge no more, remain befuddled that the balance does not disappear. The effects of that balance, interest accruing daily, are all around us.”*

The point is that wealth accumulation in America has routinely been an unfair business. Slavery happened. Marginalization in some instances and outright robbery in others enabled some individuals to get ahead of others. Some individuals did pull themselves up by their proverbial bootstraps. But for many, those bootstraps were diamond encrusted and provided at birth. If the moral debt of slavery and other forms of oppression this country has enacted has no bearing on the descendants of slavers and oppressors, why do those descendants get to enjoy the spoils of those activities?

If the actions of our ancestors don’t determine our worth, let’s start acting like it.

P.S. At some point, we are going to have to rectify our past mistakes. Though you may not be responsible for the scars on our nation’s history, stockpiling bandaids does incriminate you. When an elephant is stepping on a mouse’s tail, neutrality is not commendable.
