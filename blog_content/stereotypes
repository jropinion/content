Title: The Real Threats of Stereotypes

Our society has, in large part, finally acknowledged the pervasiveness and immorality of stereotypes. But, the way we think about stereotypes is still toxic and I'm convinced that many people don't understand the real problems stereotypes create in our society. Many people believe stereotypes are wrong because they are untrue. While many stereotypes are indeed untrue, true steretypes, if there are some, aren no more appropriate and can be equally as destructive.

###**Stereotype Threat**

The first threat of stereotypes in our society is, aptly named, stereotype threat (Steele and Aronson 1970). The unfortunate consequence of this social psychological phenomenon is that individuals who are made aware of negative stereotypes about groups they belong to tend to perform worse on tasks than people in the same group who are not aware of the stereotype.This means that when we negatively stereotype groups, we can actually negatively impact their levels of acheivement. 

This predicament is made even worse when we consider the effect of confirmation bias (Plous 1993). It is a known fact that humans tend to interpret data in a way that confirms what they already believe. That said, negative stereotypes may inform how we perceive others abilities. So, not only can stereotypes make people perform worse, they can also change how observers interpret their ability. That's an uphill battle, and in many cases, the groups in question are already at a disadvantage.

But this one abhorrent consequence of stereotypes doesn't completely encapsulate why stereotyopes are so terrible. It doesn't account for flattering stereotypes or stereotypes which may be true for some groups.

###**Stereotypes as Metrics**

The second threat of stereotypes in our society is materilaized in the way we use stereotypes. We seldom use stereotypes to discuss groups in a fact-of-the-matter way. By this I mean that we don't say things like Black individuals have a higher chance of being diagnosed with sickle cell anemia (this is true, given the prevelance of the trait for the disease in the Black community, but it is not a common stereotype) Instead, when we use stereotypes, we use them as metrics for comparison and evaluation. We stereotype groups so as to show how a group is deficient or odd or different. Much of what we do with steretypes, even when they are true, is attempt to show why or how some group is worse than our own group. We stereotype to demean.

In the process, we also reduce the dignity of individuals. We promote ideas of conformity to a preconceived notion, which robs individuals of the opportunity to explore their personhood and actualize as they would like. And, furthermore, we cheapen our social interactions, coming into them with false beliefs and ingrained biases that act as inhbiitors on true discourse.

###**Stereotypes as Blindfolds**

What I take to be the most insidious threat to our society posed by stereotypes is the how stereotypes sheild us from actually understanding how our society works. When we subscribe to the idea that a group is inherently one way, we ignore the social factors that may have been complicit in their plight. When we say, for example, that black people are prone to criminality (an idea that a shallow look at incarceration stats and arrest rates would seem to support), we ignore the the truth: Black people are policed more harshly than others, leading to higher incidences of arrest for crimes that are committed with similar frequncey across the races (e.g. drug possession and use); We ignore that centuries of slavery, segregation, and marginalization from formal economic activity has left many Blacks in poverty with limited prospects to improve their circumstances (a situation conducive to breeding criminality); we ignore that we live in a society that stresses the well-being of the individual over that of the community and thus woud rather jail the masses than invest in practical solutions.

Stereotypes help us look the other way. And we've been doing that for far too long.

P.S. You may have noticed I only talked about "true stereotypes" in a relatively ambiguous way. That's because I believe it is foolish to focus on the truthfulness of any particular stereotypes. All stereotypes when understood as I have explained them above, are detrimental to our society because it's not about the substance of a stereotype. It's about the attitudes and perceptions they breed.
