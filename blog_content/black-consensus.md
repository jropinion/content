Title: Justice For The Oppressor 
Category: Social Justice

There is an implicit argument that can be derived from two of my posts: "What Are White Men Owed?" and "Oppression Is Not Subjective". I'd like to explicitly make that argument here. 

My social justice advocacy is inspired, as I explained in the HDE series, by a desire to maximize human dignity in our society. While that goal obviously requires the dismantling of oppressive social mechanisms and purging of the attitudes that reinforce those mechanisms, it seems that it also requires justice for the oppressor. This isn't that radical an idea when justice is understood as persons receiving what they deserve. Through this schema, justice for the oppressor would mean stripping them of all the privileges and benefits our society affords them that have not been earned, with an intense focus on those privileges and benefits that keep other segments of our society from getting their fair share. 

But, justice for the oppressor also necessitates utilizing means and pursuing ends that don't inflict unnecessary pain on the oppressor or diminish their ability to lead meaningful lives too greatly. I think this is an often overlooked pice of the social justice fight and also a motivating factor for some of the social justice fights most ardent opponents.

I hold this view for two reasons: most oppressors are doing so unwittingly (maybe even, for some, unwillingly) and as a result ignoring these considerations will surely create new injustices, even if that's  hard to imagine given the power dynamics currently dictating our society.
