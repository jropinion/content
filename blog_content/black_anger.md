Title: One Black Man’s Anger

Do you understand what you ask of me when you ask me to keep my cool in the face of the atrocities against people of color in this country? Do you recognize what the substance of your request really is? Can you see the pain present in my prose? Do you care?

I usually write in the hopes of helping shape discourse and presenting new topics for discussion. But I can’t do that today. Instead, this post is just much needed catharsis. Feel free to use it as such for yourself as well.

And why might we need some cathartic relief?

Well, people who look like me keep being killed, and people who don’t look like me continue to not care. Worse yet, people who don’t look like me tell me I care too much. They say that I allow myself to be distracted; that my obsession with justice is a destructive hobby. They tell me if I cared less the problems of this nation would cease to exist, and I believe them because the not caring strategy seems to be working perfectly fine for them.

Perhaps it is my fault for being so naive as to believe that the same individuals who told me progress had already come should be trusted now when they tell me that progress is on it’s way. I know that claim to be bullshit now! 

The proliferation of videos of cops killing, mistreating, and harassing people who look like me initially filled me with deep sadness and anxiety. BUt perpetually watching killers walk free...those emotions are subsiding and quickly being replaced by rage. And, scary enough, it is not a pointed rage. It is just pure and intense.

But still, I cannot bring myself to subscribe to militancy nor can I endorse it in others. It is certainly true that our society will not change itself, but I fear the kind of change militancy produces. We can not scare people into recognizing our humanity. They are scared now; deluded by centuries or myths about our strength, moral integrity, and intelligence. And their fear only results in our deaths. We needn’t provide any excuses for full scale genocide. The civil war ended slavery, but the racism which sustained the institution lived. Racism cannot be defeated by violence. Changing the hearts of women and men, unfortunately, is a slow arduous process.That is not my way of saying be patient. It’s my way of saying be smart.

The cycle of violence against black bodies will continue until this nation actually confronts it past. We need to recognize that slavery’s end, Jim Crow’s termination, and most civil rights advances in this country happened for the wrong reasons. We ended slavery because the south ran out of people to sacrifice for it. We ended Jim Crow because economic boycotts were quite burdensome and race riots were quite destructive. We have never taken a moment to stop and realize what has been done to black people in this country. We were stripped of our personhood. We were made to be seen as perpetual threats. We were taught to hate ourselves. And then, at our lowest point we were left to our own devices. And for 150 years, the state has used violence to keep us from reclaiming our dignity. 

I’m not saying black people have no right to violent recourse and I’m not saying violence won’t create change. What I am saying is this: violence has never decreased racism. Violence has only forced it to change form.

So I ask again…

Do you understand what you ask of me when you ask me to keep my cool in the face of the atrocities against people of color in this country?

When you do that, you are disregarding my pain. You are refusing to acknowledge my suffering.

Do you recognize what the substance of your request really is?

You are asking me to walk to my demise with a smile. You offer no solace and no respect. You look the other way and ask me to do the same.

Can you see the pain present in my prose? 

Well...can you? Can you tell that sometimes my hands tremble when I write? Can you tell that I have to edit my pieces incessantly? Not for grammar and spelling, but for tone. I have to make sure I don’t sound too angry, too saddened, too bitter. Because if I do you’ll dismiss me. Hell, some of you will dismiss me anyway.

Do you care?

P.S. If rioting ensues because of the acquittal of Tamir Rice's killer...I will not condemn it. I understand the pain that leads to property destruction. I feel it, too!
