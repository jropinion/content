Title: Headline Conversations

There is a lot of information on the internet. There are near infinite perspectives on countless events coming from every direction. No topic is too unimportant to be written about, no writing is guaranteed to be topical. It’s a very intimidating world sometimes.

The need to stay in the know has us all adopting different mechanisms for remaining alert. There are news streamlining apps, there are news apps that are streamlined, social media plays a part. We are also, as I explained in “An Audience of The Like-Minded”, self-limiting and accepting external limits on the information we receive, usually opting to make that which slips through corroborative of our own biases. Unfortunately also happening: We’re not reading the news anymore: just the headlines.

Now, I don’t think that’s inherently a problem. To be honest, there is a lot (A LOT) of bullshit out there. I don’t just mean the stuff on Huffpost or Fox News. There is also a lot of malarkey spewed from “reputable” sources as the demand of the 24hour news cycle (does the internet even obey time?) mandates news be perpetually produced to be perpetually cycled. Part of that perpetual production is the need to make uninteresting events sound interesting. This is what’s happening a very high percentage of the time when you see a headline announcing some incredible finding in a research study. If you read the actual article, very often you’ll find that the actual results of the study are not as impressive as what the headline of the news article reporting on the study suggests. And, if you read the actual study, you’ll often be shocked at how little was actually said by the scientists compared to what the article says the scientist said.

For example, a recent article I read titled “The San Andreas Fault Line Showing Signs of Movement” suggests that the catastrophic earthquake scientists have suggested could occur on the West Coast may be coming or maybe there have been new developments in the saga to determining if and when California will break away from the continental United States. But no, instead the article was about how the same data that has been available for decades was now regathered with finer tools and a new strategy which yielded results consistent with the initial hypothesis, that the fault line was moving. This tells us nothing new and it brings scientist no closer to predicting when or if there will be a massive quake. Though important findings, it’s not sexy or exciting, so instead we’re told that the “San Andreas Fault Line is Moving.” 

Another great example would be the study I examined in “Feminist Climate Change.” There I discussed how the complete and total myth that women are exceptionally honest when making a rape accusation as compared to other crimes was established by a misreading of the study by the reporters of that information, and an acceptance of that misinformation by people who didn’t actually read the study, instead likely choosing to read the headline of the report on the study which probably read something like “Only 2 to 8 Percent of Rape Accusations False.” A very misleading statement.

This is similarly done with political coverage and with social commentary. We get headlines that are meant to excite us or appeal to our biases. It’s very effective at getting us to read the headline. But we stop there. More and more we’re allowing twelve words or fewer to relay to us a story that has more than twelve variables in it.

And worse yet…

We’re then going on to talk about these events as if we know. This is where the problem is exacerbated...these goddamn headline conversations. Countless times throughout the day I’m involved in or overhearing conversations where one person confidently asserts a premise and then when faced with further inquiry retreat behind the statement “I only read the headline” or “I saw it while I was scrolling.” Very often the matter being discussed is a volatile one having to do with the latest national phenomena having to do with one of the “isms” or the phobias.

You may think I’m being pretentious here, but let me ask you: how many people do you know with a strong position on the North Carolina bathroom situation? How many people do you know who have read the House Bill 2? How many people do you know with an opinion on the wage gap? How many of those people have read even one recent study on the wage gap (which all show for white women it is virtually non-existent)? How many people do you know who cited or complained of voter fraud during the Democratic primary? How many of those people do you think actually read the complaints or the articles about the complaints? 

And yet, on all these issues, and many others, people are forming very strong opinions based on snippets of information.

We need to either A: Start reading more than just headlines

Or…

B: Shut up when we’ve only read a headline. Spreading misinformation does no favors for anyone.

P.S. Oh, the irony of writing a full piece about how people only read headlines.
