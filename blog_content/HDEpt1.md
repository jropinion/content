Title: Human Dignity Explained Part 1: A Moral Existence

Perhaps you’ve noticed by now all my arguments are somehow anchored by a conception of human dignity. You may have also noticed that to this point I’ve only ambiguously explained just exactly what I mean by human dignity. And, though my reasoning may be to your liking, without a clear definition of that term and a strong justification for why my conception of human dignity should be endorsed, all my arguments are hopelessly vulnerable.

My understanding of human dignity is the product of my commitments to Kantian moral [hilosophy, specifically Kant’s Humanity As An End formulation of the Categorical Imperative. This theory of morality holds: the moral thing to do in any situation is to behave in a way such that you treat every person as an unforsakeable entity that is not expendable for utilities sake.

Embedded in my somewhat brief formulation of the moral theory is a very important term: persons. By persons, I mean entities that are rational, have free will, can celebrate/suffer and be fulfilled/disappointed, and have specific, necessary conditions for their sustenance (this way of understanding moral agents does exclude the unborn, very young children, and most animals, though there are some, e.g. dolphins and some apes, that seem to potentially have these faculties sufficiently enough to warrant moral consideration).

The rationality and free will qualifications ensure the entity in question has agency. If an entity cannot reason through and choose freely between options, then that entity does not have agency and thus cannot behave morality. This is because morality, according to Kantian moral philosophy is not merely about doing the right thing, but doing it for the right reasons as well .

On the other hand, the ability to celebrate/suffer and be fulfilled/disappointed and possessing necessary conditions for sustenance are important because they constitute the considerations one should into account when making moral decisions. If an entity doesn’t have these faculties, then, from a phenomenological perspective, your actions don’t matter to that entity. If it is literally impossible to chop down a specific tree, or damage it in any way, it is inconsequential whether or not you undertake actions to chop down that tree. If, however, a tree can be chopped down, it is worth considering whether or not you should in fact chop that tree down (substitute tree for person...note: don’t chop people down).

These qualifications are necessary because they shape the reciprocal relationship between moral duty (i.e. obligation to do or not do) and moral claims (i.e. right to receive or have someone forebear). Everywhere there is a moral claim there is a moral duty and vice-versa. Cached in the aforementioned terms, morality is a matter of rational agents with free will choosing to act in accord with the moral duty they have toward entities that have the aforementioned capacity and necessary conditions for sustenance.

Understanding this claim should shed light on why every action isn't up for moral evaluation. Actions that don't involve both a moral claim and a moral duty are not morally pertinent. Morality always involves a rational subject and a vulnerable object. The two can be one in the same. It isn't weird, for example, to say someone is living an immoral life based on how their decisions affect themselves.

Lastly Moral duties can be unfulfilled and moral claims can be ignored. After all, morality is a choice. It is for that reason we find it praiseworthy when individuals behave morally and contemptible when they do not. Also, morality is only one of many other considerations; utility, for example, being another. By this I mean that a person can undertake an immoral or amoral action that is justifiable by another standard. This may seem weird to people who think morality is the final answer to every questions of rightness or wrongness, but recall that I specified a family of actions that are not in the moral arena at all (those lacking a moral claim or a moral duty or both). In those situations there is an obvious need for another standard other than morality to evaluate those actions. If that is true, then it should be no surprise that other such standards do exist and in fact can sometimes clash with moral concerns.

A moral existence, then, one filled with moral actions and moral treatment: it's a life in which one's humanity is respected; a life in which one's actions (at least those susceptible to moral evaluation) appropriately treat others; a life in which one is seldom treated as a means to an end. 

P.S. This was the easy part.
