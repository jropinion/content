Title: Human Dignity Explained Part 1: A Moral Existence

Perhaps you’ve noticed by now all my arguments are somehow anchored by a conception of human dignity. You may have also noticed that to this point I’ve only ambiguously explained just exactly what I mean by human dignity. And, though my reasoning may be to your liking, without a clear definition of that term and a strong justification for why my conception of human dignity should be endorsed, all my arguments are hopelessly vulnerable.

My understanding of Human dignity is the product of my commitments to Kantian Moral Philosophy, specifically Kant’s Humanity as an end Formulation of the Categorical Imperative.This theory of morality holds: the moral thing to do in any situation is to behave in a way such that you treat every person as an unforsakeable entity that is not expendable for utilities sake.

Embedded in my somewhat brief formulation of the moral theory is a very important term: persons. By persons, I mean entities that are rational, have free will, can celebrate/suffer and be fulfilled/disappointed, and have specific, necessary conditions for their existence.

The rationality and free will qualifications ensure that the entity is question has agency. If an entity can not reason through options and then choose freely between options, than that entity does not have agency and thus cannot behave morality. This is because morality, according to Kantian Moral Philosophy is not merely about doing the right thing, but doing it for the right reasons as well (this way of understanding moral agents does exclude the unborn, very young children, and most animals, though there are some, e.g. dolphins and some apes, that seem to potentially have these faculties sufficiently enough to warrant moral consideration).

On the other hand, the ability to celebrate/suffer and be fulfilled/disappointed and possessing necessary conditions for existence are important because they constitute the considerations one should into account when making moral decisions. If an entity doesn’t have these faculties, then, from a phenomenological perspective, your actions don’t matter to that entity. If it is literally impossible to chop down a specific tree, or damage it in any way, it is inconsequential whether or not you undertake actions to chop down that tree. If, however, a tree can be chopped down, it is worth considering whether or not you should in fact chop that tree down (substitute tree for person...note: don’t chop people down).

Both these sets of qualifications are necessary because they help shape the reciprocal relationship between moral duty (i.e. obligation to do or not do) and moral claims (i.e. right to receive or have someone forebear). Everywhere there is a moral claim there is a moral duty and vice-versa. Cached in the aforementioned terms, morality is a matter of rational agents with free will choosing to act in accord with the moral duty they have toward entities that have the aforementioned capacity and necessary conditions for existence.

Moral duties can be ignored. After all, morality is choice. It is for that reason we find it praiseworthy when individuals behave morally and contemptible when they do not. Also, morality is only one of many considerations; utility for example being another. By this I mean that a person can undertake an immoral action that is justifiable by another standard.

P.S. This was the easy part.
