Title: 3 New Fights For The Church
Category: Religion
Date: 2015/07/02

The landmark Supreme Court decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges* has, at least for the moment, settled the question of whether or not gays and lesbians can be denied marriage equality in America based on the preferences of the people they share a state with: they can’t be! For many religious organizations and devoutly religious individuals, *Obergefell* is a crushing defeat considering the many years of stern advocacy for a “traditional definition of marriage”, and the corresponding heterosexism it entailed. Now, religious social entities are left with three choices: continue to vehemently oppose same-sex marriage and advocate the reversal of the decision in *Obergefell* like school segregationists did following *Brown v. Board of Education* (not the best company but it is a choice); relinquish their prized spot as one of America’s leading agencies of social organization (unlikely but a man can dream); or adopt a new cause. If, by the grace of God, the latter is your pick, here are some suggestions for what that new fight could be:

*But first…*

Let’s get one thing straight: YOU ARE IN NO WAY OPPRESSED BY THIS RULING! Your life hasn’t been made harder, your religion isn’t under attack, and you are not a victim. Yes, the ruling may mean you’ll have to step outside of your comfort zone and actually deal same-sex intimacy and marriages being a part of your reality now. But you should think of it more as a chance to grow; an opportunity to confront the knee-jerk “I don’t understand this or like it so it must be wrong” reaction. Instead, embrace the progress our society has made. What progress? Oh, well, that’s simple: sexual preference is no longer a means by which people can be marginalized; at least by the government.

As for the concern many have about being ostracized because they still believe in “traditional marriage”, don’t worry, that won’t happen. No one who believes in marriage has a problem with you believing in “traditional marriage”. By all means, please, go ahead and get “traditionally married”. Lead a traditional life complete with polio, World Wars, horse-drawn carriages, and union-less factory work. But, if your belief in traditional marriage also comes with the belief that your religious or personal preferences should be the litmus test for other people’s social decisions for no other reason than that it’s how you feel, then that might get you into some trouble. If you can believe the first thing and not the second one, no ostracism for you.

Now, about those new fights.

###**Global Climate Change**

If you believe your creator gave you a planet complete with all the things necessary for survival, then perhaps it is time the church start using its influence to get people to treat it as such. Our current way of living is unsustainable. Our industrial practices, the way we generate energy, and the rate at which we consume it, are producing way too much greenhouse gas and as a result the global temperature is rising leading to more extreme weather events, rising sea-levels, and the displacement of populations of both human and non-human animals. This isn't an opinion. 97% of Scientific papers that take a position on the topic agree that human activity is behind this phenomena, or so says NASA, the government, and a bunch of scientific journals. While it is too late to “stop” climate change (it's already happening), it is certainly not too late to alter our practices so we can slow the rate of climate change and thus give ourselves a fighting chance.

The kinds of changes necessary to make our hope of combating accelerated climate change a reality are drastic. The church has always been able to mobilize people for large, daunting causes. Helping people understand the moral imperative to act and the severe consequences of inaction would be an indispensable use of the church’s influence.

###**Income Inequality**

In America, according to literally everyone, income inequality is bad. The Atlantic reports that the richest 10% of Americans own as much wealth as the other 90% and the top 1% hold down about 20% of our nation’s economic resources. Isn’t there something in the bible about greed and depriving the poor and charity?

You know like:

**Matthew 19 21** Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.

or

**Mark 4 19** but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.

or

**Ecclesiastes 5 10** Whoever loves money never has enough;    whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless.

or

**1 Timothy 6 17-19** Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.


or

**Psalms 49 10-12** For he sees that even wise men die; the stupid and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others. Their inner thought is that their houses are forever and their dwelling places to all generations; they have called their lands after their own names. But man in his pomp will not endure; he is like the beasts that perish.

These verses and others suggest the church can and should have much to say about income inequality and the inequitable hoarding of wealth. Contemporary America presents a unique opportunity for the church to use its influence to advocate progressive tax policies and fairer wage practices. Just saying, income inequality is a kind of fucking the church should actually combat.

###**Integration**

Now I know this seems like a non-starter since we don’t have official state sponsored segregation anymore...but we do have pretty intense *de facto* segregation. According to the New York Times, public schools in New York are very segregated, and they fit nicely into the trend of segregated public schools in major cities around the country. And make no mistake about it, these schools are separate and unequal. But it get’s worse.

Our neighborhoods are also segregated. Actually, one might even venture to say that’s why our schools are segregated, but I wouldn’t want to be accused of radical hypothesizing. But seriously, according to the Washington Post, blacks are twice as likely as whites to live in racial isolation. Now call me naive, but I truly believe much of the Nation’s race problem would dissipate in just a few generations if our society were racially integrated. The media would lose some of its productive power, there would be an influx of wealth into many poorer communities, and a shared sense of ownership and inspired sense of community would breed racial tolerance and understanding. Simply put: we’d like each other more if we knew each other.

And what social institution can make people look past their fears and embark on revolutionary social change...the church! The church can help people unite over shared faith and common value systems and use those commonalities to foster other connections. Surely that is already happening in services across the country. We just need to expand that to our living quarters. Instead of keeping gays apart, how about bringing the races together.

Now, don’t get me wrong: I know all churches don’t oppose marriage equality and some churches do take an active role in advocating all the things I’ve mentioned above. The fact is, however, a lot of precious influence is being wasted demonizing gays and attempting to undermine social progress. That doesn’t have to be the case. 

P.S. I know I promised a post about deliberative theory, but this felt more pressing to me. That post is coming, though. And lastly, congrats to the many gays and lesbians in states with recently lifted marriage bans. It is not just a victory for you; it is a beacon of hope for all of us who believe in social justice (even if Anthony Kennedy’s opinion is an abomination to everything constitutional law should be, but that’s a discussion for another day).
