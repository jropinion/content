Title: Conservative Inconsistencies Surrounding Race
Category: Race
Date: 2015/04/30

Conservatives are quick to claim that they take an objective approach to race issues. They say they survey the facts and come to conclusions based purely on the evidence provided. Above all, they insist that race doesn’t influence their perception of events at all. But the repeated conservative discourse around race issues, especially those involving an unarmed black person being murdered by police and the aftermath, suggest otherwise.

###**General Suspicion of Law Enforcement**

Most conservatives are quick to reject social welfare policies and other such measures because they believe the government is generally a bad thing. They reach a fever pitch when the government invades their privacy (Patriot Act, NSA metadata collection, etc.). And yet, time and time again these same individuals turn a blind eye to the excessive policing and intrusive policies undertaken by the police with respect to colored individuals. Where is the outrage in these cases? People are being demeaned and killed, but, for some reason, conservatives routinely stand on the side of law enforcement.

This is especially obvious when the National Guard is called in to keep people from exercising their first amendment right to assemble and conservatives celebrate. I always thought a conservative's worst fear was a military state which purposefully and willfully trampled the rights of individuals in an attempt to make the government unaccountable to the people for its actions. That is literally what is happening in Baltimore and what happened in Ferguson.

###**Cops vs. Rioters**

When critics of the overpolicing and abuse of blacks by the police voice concerns about the rate at which black individuals are assaulted and murdered by cops, conservatives are quick to counter that not all cops are bad. They insist that the actions of some bad cops are not reason enough to be generally skeptical of all cops or the institution of policing. A valid point.

But, when very small factions of protesters riot, these same individuals use the riots as a focal point to delegitimize the otherwise peaceful efforts. It is very suspicious that time and time again the same individuals abandon their individual scrutiny methodology to condemn entire demonstrations as bad based on the actions of few individuals.

Furthermore, when a cop kills an unarmed civilian, conservatives leave no stone unturned looking for an explanation. They assume all kinds of things about the murdered individual and are quick to accept any narrative that exonerates the cop. But, when angry protesters flip a car or break some windows, they are unilaterally called thugs and animals, rioters and looters. There is seldom an inquiry into their motivations. Suddenly, the context doesn’t matter.
###**Rioters vs Rioters**

White people riot all the time. Usually for nothing. They riot over sports events and pumpkins. Black people tend to riot after racial atrocities. Unfortunately, conservatives only label one of these groups savages. A riot is a riot. Why are some more justified than others? Is it because white people riot out of happiness? Is white destruction of property less expensive?

###**Free Speech**

When a white news personality or celebrity or some other entity says something racially insensitive, conservatives are quick to trumpet free speech. They insist that our country was founded on the ability of all individuals to spread ideas even if the masses find them disagreeable. When social commentators attempt to explain systemic racism, conservatives demand their silence. They claim they are poisoning our society and keeping racism alive by talking about it. The same is true with respect to a lot of conversatives attitudes about hip-hop which should, they say, be done away with because of it's poisonous messages. Conservatives also insist that LGBTQ personalities not be promoted on TV so they can avoid a tough conversation with their children. So much for the free spread of ideas.

###**Reverse Racism**

Conservatives take an almost uniform position on racism: it doesn’t exist. Many suggest that all the statistics that show it is a measurable disadvantage to be black in this country can be dismissed as cultural problems and misleading correlations. But, somehow, reverse racism is real. After hundreds of years of slavery, segregation, and other nefarious forms of oppression, conservatives actually argue that it is white people that are under attack in this country. I struggle to see how clear discrimination in hiring practices and obvious disparities in access to resources like education and housing are not racist or the product of racism, but Michelle Obama suggesting to black girls that they rock, imbuing one of society's most vulnerable populations with a sense of self worth, is racist. Racism is not about hurt feelings. It’s about structures functioning to deprive individuals of access to resources in a way predictable by race. But that aside, if there is no racism, how can there be reverse racism.

P.S. I’m excited to see how conservatives will explain away these seeming contradiction. There does seem to be one variable that explains these differing approaches. Racism! But I would never level that charge. It would be reverse racist, I think.
